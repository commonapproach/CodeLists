# CodeLists
Development repository of code lists published or maintained by [Common Approach](https://www.commonapproach.org).

This repository contains public development files for some of the code lists used in the Common Approach ontologies. Some code lists are hosted for other organisations, are an "Ontologized" version of existing standards and others are published and curated by Common Approach. Please see the documentation on individual files. Concerns and comments can be made by filing an issue.

The authoritive version of these code lists is provided on the Common Approach Ontology Server using [HTTP Content Negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation).
