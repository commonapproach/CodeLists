This metric should exclude Temporary Employee Wages (OI4202).

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.</skos:scopeNote>

These data may be most effectively collected through either school reporting (for private schools) or government reporting (for public schools).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique smallholder farmer clients who received the organization's products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of client transactions. For example, a smallholder farmer customer who makes two purchases during a period should only be counted once. Organizations wishing to report on client purchases should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

Since this metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals serviced, organizations should not apply any household multipliers to their reports against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Organizations that rely on assumptions to report against this metric, including in the process for determining the number of client individuals, should footnote all assumptions used in their calculation process.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

The standard unit of measure for International Finance Institutions (IFIs) is GWh. For other Units of Measure, refer to Unit of Measure (PD1602).

To disaggregate this total by the type of energy generated for sale—for example, non-renewable vs. renewable sources—report this metric disaggregated by the relevant options from Primary Energy Source (OI3781).

Organizations interested in reporting energy production at the product level should report Energy Capacity of Products Sold (PD1504), Energy Capacity of Product (PD2713), or both.

Organizations wishing to report the amount of energy generated for their own use should instead report Energy Generated for Use: Total (OI9624).

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact).

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the basic demographic groups in an organization's ownership. The thresholds by group follow these sources:
- Gender: 51% female or gender non-binary, following the 2X Challenge criteria (https://www.2xchallenge.org/criteria).

This disaggregation, applied to another metric, is intended to capture the share of that metric which relates to the selected demographic groups in ownership. For example, when applied to Client Organizations (PI9652), this disaggregation would capture the number of client organizations with ownership in the selected demographic group(s).

Owners should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The IRIS catalog differentiates between land that the organization directly controls and land that the organization indirectly controls. This metric is intended to capture the area of land that is under the organization's direct control.

Direct control refers to land for which the organization controls land use through direct operation or management, including situations in which the organization's employees cultivate the land directly. Note that land ownership is not always equivalent to control. For example, where land is leased to another entity or individual to cultivate (e.g., a third-party manager), land is only directly controlled if the lease is accompanied by exhaustive criteria for land use.

Such land-use criteria are often included in management plans and legal agreements that also incorporate sustainability principles and typically include termination provisions in the event of poor performance. To the extent that the third-party manager must make minimal, ad-hoc, and discretionary land-use decisions that fall outside the scope of the land-use criteria, the land may still be considered directly controlled by the organization.

This metric includes crops cultivated through low-till and no-till methods.</skos:scopeNote>

Where possible, organizations should aim to report the related metric Average Student Test Score (PI9024), which captures growth in test scores rather than an absolute pass rate.

Organizations may disaggregate data by grade level as needed to identify underlying patterns.

In all contexts, tests should reflect learners' social, environmental, and learning norms and needs. Organizations are encouraged to footnote details on how and by whom tests have been developed, as well as how they are fit to context.

Improvements can result from energy-efficient construction/renovation investments within the organization’s operations or by reducing the amount of energy needed to carry out the same processes or tasks. This metric is not intended to capture reduced energy consumption that results from reduced organizational activities (e.g., partial outsourcing).

Organizations should footnote the types of energy-conservation techniques employed (e.g., process redesign) and the types of energy reduced (e.g., fuel, electricity, steam).

Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including the basis for calculating reductions in energy consumption (such as base year or baseline) and the rationale for choosing that basis. For example, if the reporting period is annual, organizations should report on the difference in energy consumption between the current year and previous year. Additionally, organizations are encouraged to footnote energy conserved as a percentage of the total energy consumed by the organization.

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Energy Generated for Use: Total (OI9624), Energy Purchased: Total (OI8825), and Energy Conservation Strategy (OI4531).

Put inversely, this metric is intended to capture the degree to which rivers and streams are fragmented, which can negatively impact stream health, land health, and biodiversity within ecosystems.

In addition to remote sensing data, organizations may use tools such as WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) or WWF-DEG's Water Risk Filter (http://waterriskfilter.panda.org/) to find data on and describe stream connectivity on directly or indirectly managed land.

Assessing stream connectivity helps to understand a project’s contribution to preserving biodiversity, as fragmentation of natural habitat is a primary driver of biodiversity loss. This indicator corresponds to the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, which aims to improve biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether (other) private sector firms entered the organization’s market during the reporting period. In some contexts, this metric measures increased competition that may be related to the organization’s success. However, the entry of new firms should not be attributed directly to the organization’s activities, nor can it be fully attributed to a specific intervention.

Increased competition in a relevant market is often accompanied by an increase in product or service quality or a decrease in product or service price, though these trends alone do not always indicate an entry of new firms; in particular, these trends may also result from the reaction of existing players in relevant markets to new entrants or potential new entrants. However, the entry of new firms into a market is easier to measure than changes in the strategy or positioning of existing firms in that market.

This metric applies only if the organization is expected to attract other firms to the same market and may be used alongside New Market Entry (OI3441) or Market Share Increased (OI4211). Data for this metric may be tracked annually (throughout a project cycle) or through an evaluation or survey.

For example, an organization that helps identify products and methods that conserve water (such as low-flow products, rain-collection devices, irrigation timers, or leak correctors) would report the total water savings to its clients resulting from these provided services.

Organizations should take care to use the same reporting period for both the number of clients and the average water savings per client.

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique low-income clients who received the organization's products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

The population classified as low income includes all those who fall below a fixed threshold, which includes those classified as poor or very poor. Because assessing the poverty level of stakeholders is complex, organizations will likely use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

Organizations can themselves determine the precise threshold at which they report suppliers. In most cases, organizations should include only those enterprises supplying goods and services that are fundamental to the operations of the reporting organization.

Individual organizations’ definitions of local will depend on their business models and impact objectives. For example, if their purpose is economic development, they may define “local” within geo-political boundaries. If they focus on reducing emissions, they may define “local” by specific distance.

Organizations should not include subcontractors as part of this metric; subcontractors can be reported under Temporary Employees (OI9028) and its related submetrics.

This metric is intended to capture the average output per hectare for smallholder farmers among an organization's clients.

Organizations should not calculate this metric using aggregate data across all smallholder farmers. Rather, as noted in the calculation, organizations should use smallholder farmer–specific data. Organizations should report yield from the most recent harvest and footnote details on the unit of measure.

This metric could be valuable for organizations that sell inputs (such as fertilizer or irrigation equipment) to smallholder farmers that help improve yields.

Organizations interested in reporting the yields of supplier farmers should report Average Supplier Agricultural Yield: Smallholder (PI1405).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also identify a specific the WHO dimension subdimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

Climate change raises sea levels and intensifies storms, and coast erosion and land loss are a consequence. Restoring reefs, mangroves, and other stabilizing and wave-mitigating infrastructure can help create climate-resilient coasts. Protecting aquatic ecosystems near coastlines also counters the biodiversity decline threatened by the degrading effects of land use changes, pollutants, and invasive species.

Training costs vary widely depending on the level of services provided to participants, whether or not an organization has staff dedicated to engaging employer networks, the level of need in the community where the program is located (greater need requires more outreach), or provision of financial support to participants. These factors can make comparisons of employee training costs across organizations difficult, if not accompanied by additional metrics that specify the level of services provided and level of local need.

For tools that may be helpful in calculating this and related metrics, see GHG Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools).

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) classifies direct emissions as "Scope 1" emissions. The GHG Protocol, the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions, defines direct emissions as emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity. For more information on the GHG Protocol, organizations should refer to the following:
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards)
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools)

Direct GHG emissions come from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting organization. For example, direct emissions related to combustion would arise from burning fuel for energy within the reporting organization's operational boundaries.

Organizations are also encouraged to report Greenhouse Gas Emissions Strategy (OI8237).

    <cids:hasDescription xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture detailed information on the organization’s water conservation strategy in place but does not evaluate the success with which that strategy is implemented.

Water conservation encompasses efforts made to reduce the amount of water needed to execute current processes or tasks. This metric is not intended to capture overall reduced water consumption due to reduced organizational activities (e.g., partial outsourcing of production).

Details of water conservation efforts to footnote include organizational or technological innovations that allow a defined process or task to consume water more efficiently. These may include improved water-management practices, process redesign, the conversion and retrofitting of equipment (e.g., water-efficient equipment), or the elimination of unnecessary water use through changes in behavior. Organizations’ water-reduction strategies could also include seeking alternative water sources such as gray water or rainwater capture systems. Organizations should footnote which efforts are components of their strategy.

Mismanagement of water can pose risks to operational elements including brand, credibility, credit rating, insurance, and operating costs. Organizations should footnote their analysis of such risks and how they are being addressed.

Organizations are encouraged to report the amount of water conserved using Water Conserved (OI4015) and Water Used: Total (OI1697), plus its related submetrics.</cids:hasDescription>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote details about the policy, including the types of discrimination protected against and the systems in place to ensure compliance. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the organization’s policy to combat discrimination in the workplace. Anti-discrimination policies, often called non-discrimination or equal employment opportunity policies, prohibit or penalize discrimination on the basis of age; color; disability; gender expression; gender identity; HIV status; marital status; national, social, or ethnic origin; participation in collective bargaining agreements; political opinion; race; religion; or sexual orientation. Such policies prohibit making recruitment, compensation, termination, promotion, or any other conditions of employment contingent upon any of the affiliations listed above for any employee or job applicant.

Organizations can refer to the following sources for additional information on best practices:

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including source of data. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique clients who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period for the first time. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

Depending on the industry and business model, organizations may define new clients as those who re-engage with the organization after a designated time period. For example, the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX) defines new borrowers as either those who receive loans for the first time from the institution or borrowers who rejoin after more than one year.

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

Distributors counted under this metric need not exclusively sell the organization’s products or services. Direct employees who distribute the organization's goods or services should be considered employees, not distributors.

Because assessing the poverty level of stakeholders is complex, organizations will likely have to use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the area of land controlled or monitored by the organization that has been deforested. Above- and below-ground food networks in forests have developed over hundreds of years. Forests provide habitats for species and provide a range of ecosystem services. Their disappearance leads to loss in biodiversity, decline in soil quality (for example, erosion and nutrients), and intensification of climate change.

Land may be deforested for multiple reasons and using multiple methods (e.g., clear-cutting, burning). Organizations should footnote these details.

Organizations can report this metric in conjunction with Area of Land Reforested (PI4907).

Organizations are encouraged to closely monitor deforestation and its causes through remote sensing data, tracking the evolution and speed of deforestation over time. Organizations should also track the consequences for forests of natural disasters, harvesting, illegal logging, and other negative outcomes.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations can average actual yield data or survey a representative sample. For example, if evaluating average agricultural yield of client farmers using Client Individuals (PI4060), organizations could average actual yield data per farmer or survey representative individual farmers.

Organizations should report yield separately for each agricultural product, reporting the relevant product with Crop Type (PD1620) or Livestock/Fish Type (PD4686), as appropriate. Organizations should also report yield from the most recent harvest and footnote details on the unit of measure per hectare (such as kilograms or bushels) using Unit of Measure (PD1602).

This metric could be valuable for organizations that sell inputs (such as fertilizer or irrigation equipment) to farmers that help improve yields.

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact).

According to the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) Methodology, a living wage is defined as enough to provide a decent living for a worker and their family based on a regular work week, not including overtime hours. A living wage is sufficient to cover food, water, clothing, transport, education, health care, and other essential needs for workers and their officially entitled dependents, along with some discretionary income. Workers should also receive equal pay for equal work. For more on this definition, see CHRB (https://www.corporatebenchmark.org/).

Since the living wage varies with geography, IRIS+ does not define a living wage. However, the following resources are recommended for companies with workers located in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or the United States. Organizations with workers in other geographies may reference the Global Living Wage Coalition (https://www.globallivingwage.org) to find out if a living wage benchmark is available in that geography.

- Living Wage Canada (http://livingwagecanada.ca)
- Living Wage for Ireland (https://www.livingwage.ie)
- Living Wage New Zealand (https://www.livingwage.org.nz/)
- UK: Living Wage Foundation (http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation)
- United States: MIT Living Wage Calculator (http://livingwage.mit.edu)

All organizations should footnote the living wage levels they have used for this metric.

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the adequacy of target stakeholders’ access to food by asking them directly about their experiences. Organizations should apply this metric to a metric or set of metrics that defines the relevant set of target stakeholders. For example, some organizations might report Client Households: Total (PI7954), disaggregated by relevant options from Target Stakeholder Demographics (PD5752). Other organizations with a different target stakeholder might instead apply this metric to Supplier Individuals: Total (PI5350).

This indicator is based on and refers to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) developed by FAO’s Voices of the Hungry Project. The FIES is an experience-based measure of food insecurity severity that relies on people’s direct responses to questions about their experiences facing constrained access to food. The FIES can be used to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity at different levels of severity, which is key information for implementing policies that aim to realize the human right to food. The FIES Survey Module (FIES-SM) comprises eight questions regarding people's access to adequate food and can be easily integrated into various types of surveys. For more on FIES, including the questions translated into over 170 languages, link to SDG 2.1.2, and free data analysis tools, see FAO’s FIES website (https://www.fao.org/in-action/voices-of-the-hungry/background/en/).

Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

If the organization completed a racial equity audit before the reporting period began, organizations should select “No.” Organizations, and especially investing organizations, should complete racial equity audits regularly to guide both internal practices and external activities. The outcome of the audit should inform the organization's racial equity strategy by leading to an action plan, and the organization should promptly mitigate any inequities identified. For further guidance on racial equity audits, including tools, see the Resources tab in the IRIS+ Racial Equity theme. Organizations may also consult the Resources section of this metric for guidance on how racial equity audits can be most effective and what tools exist to support equity audits.

Organizations should footnote details on how and by whom the audit was conducted. For further guidance and examples of racial equity audits, see Majority Action (https://www.racialjustice.majorityaction.us/racial-equity-auditing) and SOC Investment Group (https://www.socinvestmentgroup.com/racial-equity-audit).

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of financial professionals (individuals) affiliated with the organization who were candidates to manage money and securities—that is, those individuals in the pipeline—on behalf of one or more clients with the goal of growing the asset value. Organizations should count all individuals in the pipeline at any point during the reporting period, regardless of whether or not they made investments.

Both indirectly and directly investing organizations may use this metric. For indirectly investing organizations (sometimes termed asset owners), this metric refers to the number of asset managers/fund managers that externally manage their assets. For directly investing organizations, this metric refers to the number of asset managers working within the organization to manage funds.

Used along with Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to specify historically marginalized groups due to race and/or ethnicity, this metric aligns with the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance’s (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/) Investor Blueprint for Racial Equity and its corporate-focused CEO Blueprint for Racial Equity (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/2021-blueprint).</skos:scopeNote>

Population area data may be best sourced from census records or other municipal, regional, or national records. For locations where population varies significantly at different times of the year, organizations should footnote these seasonal shifts.

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote details on their or their product’s biodiversity footprint and how it was assessed, including all assumptions used. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the organization’s or product’s biodiversity footprint, a measure of impact on the intactness of an ecosystem usually expressed relative to an undisturbed state. Biodiversity footprint can be assessed at the level of a product, a project, a site, or the entire organization. While it does not require time- and cost-intensive field surveys, this metric is not intended to offer an extremely accurate or holistic picture of biodiversity performance. Organizations can apply this metric in benchmarking (‘which companies in my portfolio are scoring well in terms of biodiversity?’), tracking progress to target (‘are companies in my portfolio evolving towards improved biodiversity performance?’), and comparison (‘which investment options are most promising in terms of biodiversity performance?’).

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.

Organizations are encouraged to apply standard indicators for biodiversity footprint. Typically based on a combination of extent (surface), condition, and significance of the local ecosystem, commonly applied condition indicators include Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF), often combined with surface metrics (e.g., MSA.ha or MSA per hectare). PDF expresses the (potential) loss of species, while MSA expresses the abundance of species remaining (MSA, as a measure of current intactness, is preferred for this IRIS indicator). These indicators are often normalized to fall between 0 and 1; with MSA, for instance, no biodiversity is left when MSA = 0, while a very pristine area has MSA = 1. Both MSA
and PDF can be used across all sectors and across all countries and (eco)regions. For more on these measures as well as an overall discussion of the biodiversity footprint and its application to different asset classes, see the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF)’s “Paving the way towards a harmonised biodiversity accounting approach for the financial sector” (https://www.pbafglobal.com/about-pbaf#first-version-of-the-pbaf-standard).

Available biodiversity measurement tools use models that include drivers of biodiversity loss such as land use changes, GHG emissions, and pollution. Organizations are encouraged, albeit with caution, to embrace innovative measurement approaches to improve accuracy. Interesting work to standardize data and measurement approaches is available from:
- European Business &amp; Biodiversity Platform’s workstreams on methods (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/biodiversity/business/workstreams/methods/index_en.htm)
- WWF (2021, https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_assessing_portfolio_impacts_final.pdf)
- Pioneers (with an explicit focus on the financial sector).
- Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF) (https://www.pbafglobal.com/about-pbaf#first-version-of-the-pbaf-standard).

The Guide on Biodiversity Measurement Approaches from the Finance for Biodiversity Community provides excellent biodiversity measurement approaches at the portfolio level that are highly relevant for financial institutions:
- Biodiversity Footprint for Financial Institutions (BFFI)
- Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) and the Biodiversity Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF)
- Species Threat Abatement and Restoration (STAR) indicator

Investors are strongly encouraged to contextualize their projects – and ideally select projects – based on broader, country- or region-level biodiversity and landscape assessments focused on site irreplaceability. Viewing biodiversity through the lens of a systematic conservation plan enables more efficient, impact goal-oriented management decisions.

For an example of one financial institution’s process and approach, see BNP Paribas’s “Our roadmap for addressing biodiversity loss” (https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/investing/our-roadmap-to-addressing-biodiversity-loss/).</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional guidance on defining management. The composition of management varies with an organization's stage and type, but managers are generally responsible for setting objectives (defining goals for the group and deciding what work must be done to meet those goals), organizing (dividing work into manageable activities and selecting the right people to accomplish them), motivating and communicating (creating a team out of individuals through decisions on pay, promotion, and communications), measuring (establishing targets and interpreting and analyzing performance), and developing people.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations should use this metric in combination with Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation Types (OI9839) in order to disaggregate the types of GHG emissions avoided that are relevant to the organization's activities.

This metric refers to GHG emissions avoided during the reporting period. GHG emissions avoidance is typically attributed to product replacement; organizations can therefore use this metric in conjunction with Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Product (PD9427) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Product Replaced (PD2243).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of grievances that were formally entered into the organization's employee grievance mechanism during the reporting period. This metric does not capture the number of grievances resolved or dismissed during the reporting period, which should be reported under Number of Employee Grievances Resolved (OI9077). To capture whether the organization has an employee grievance and feedback system in general, organizations should use Employee Feedback and Grievance System (OI3601).

Organizations are also encouraged to footnote the ownership of the mechanism, the purpose of the mechanism and its relationship to other grievance mechanisms, the organization’s activities that are covered by the mechanism, the intended users of the mechanism, how the mechanism is managed, the process to address and resolve grievances (including how decisions are made), and the effectiveness criteria used (see GRI 103-2).

Effective grievance mechanisms should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning (GRI 2018). For operational-level mechanisms to be effective, they should be based on engagement and dialogue. For a description of each of these criteria, see Guiding Principle 31. United Nations (UN), ‘Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework,’ 2011.

Organizations should report all land area controlled by other entities that forms a contiguous assemblage with protected land area directly or indirectly controlled by the reporting organization.

For many conservation objectives, large, connected areas of conserved land are more valuable than small, disconnected pieces of conserved land. This metric helps capture holistically how a specific project complements previous conservation work. Adjacent land that is also subject to conservation measures maximizes the impact of conservation measures in newly protected areas. Potential adverse effects of adjacent land use, which organizations can footnote, may extend into the protected area. On the other hand, the transition area (ecotone) between the protected area and adjacent land can provide edge habitats that support rich biodiversity.

Remote sensing data or field visits can capture the area and land use of adjacent parcels, including details on their extent, vegetation, species, and relief, which can help optimize management in controlled area. Organizations may footnote whether neighboring land is under deliberate management, has future plans for conversation or use, or has owner(s) with potential interest in cooperating on conservation management.</skos:scopeNote>

Service coverage is a key indicator for water service providers (see aligned IBNET indicator 1.3).

The need to estimate the population served by public water points may affect the confidence that can be placed on the service coverage measure. The WHO Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 defined reasonable access as “the availability of at least 20 litres per person per day from a source within one kilometer of the user’s dwelling.” Water.org recommends that organizations use "population within 250m of a public water point" as the underlying definition for this metric.

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

For aquatic biodiversity, the Ocean Data Viewer by Ocean+ (see https://data.unep-wcmc.org/ and https://oceanplus.org/) includes various spatial datasets, such as the distribution of coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrasses.

Organizations may find emerging methods such as e-DNA and bioacoustics particularly useful for this measure – while data analysis requires specialized training, data collection can be done at the project level by laypersons.

This metric may be used in combination with Species Conservation Status (PD6429) to quantify the number of species present that are in threatened, endangered, and other conservation statuses. See Species Conservation Status (PD6429) for further information and data sources.
Organizations are encouraged, albeit with caution, to embrace innovative measurement approaches to improve accuracy of this measure. Interesting work to standardize data and measurement approaches is available from:
-European Business &amp; Biodiversity Platform’s workstreams on methods (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/biodiversity/business/workstreams/methods/index_en.htm)
-WWF (2021, https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_assessing_portfolio_impacts_final.pdf)
•	Pioneers (with an explicit focus on the financial sector).

Investors are strongly encouraged to contextualize their projects – and ideally select projects – based on broader, country- or region-level biodiversity and landscape assessments focused on site irreplaceability. Viewing biodiversity through the lens of a systematic conservation plan enables more efficient, impact goal-oriented management decisions.</skos:scopeNote>

Founder(s) counted must retain an active role in the organization as of the end of the reporting period. An active role may include acting in an advisory capacity for key decisions. It need not necessarily require a full-time role at the organization.

Client organizations are synonymous with investees for impact investors.

If using this metric to capture the number of women-founded investees, practitioners may refer to specific gender benchmarks and application guidance as needed, such as those specified by the 2X Challenge (www.2xchallenge.org).

    <cids:hasDescription xml:lang="en">Number of full-time equivalent employees working for enterprises financed or supported by the organization as of the end of the reporting period.</cids:hasDescription>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. Organizations that report data for more than one reporting period should be careful to very clearly footnote which they are using for this metric.  See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture jobs maintained during the reporting period at directly supported or financed enterprises. Organizations should measure the number of maintained full-time equivalent positions at the organization, regardless of the number of unique individuals employed or the positions they held. For example, if a full-time equivalent employee resigns and the position is filled, this position should count as just one full-time equivalent job maintained, and none created. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects.

Organizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation).

The three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.

Direct jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).

While this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.

If there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.

This metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the level of baseline water stress on land managed by the organization.

Climate change and water scarcity are inextricably linked and self-reinforcing. Biodiversity and much of the global population face water shortages due to drying out of habitats, leading to drinking water shortages, salinization, and failed harvests. Knowledge of water stress levels can guide organizations’ design and focus of sustainable water management plans, including irrigation methods, urban planning, and wastewater reuse.

Organizations may use tools such as the Water Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) or WWF–DEG's Water Risk Filter (http://waterriskfilter.panda.org/) to find data on and describe water stress on directly or indirectly managed land. Remote sensing data are also a valuable source of information on water stress and its impact on ecosystems anywhere in the world; such data are often available at small spatial scale, if needed.

This metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture waste reductions that result from products the organization produces and sells. For example, an organization that develops, manufactures, and markets machines used to recycle beverage containers (i.e., reverse vending machines) may report the amount of consumers' waste reduced by recycling containers over the lifetime of the machines sold. Organizations should report the lifetime waste reductions of those products sold during the reporting period; much of the waste reduction may actually occur after the reporting period, throughout the remainder of the products' lifetime.

Such waste reduction might include efforts to reduce (i.e., using fewer inputs), reuse (e.g., repurposing rather than disposing or recycling excess inputs or unwanted outputs), or recycle (e.g., through established systems or through on-site processing) materials or energy through the products sold by the organization.

Organizations wishing to report waste reductions achieved through their operations should report Waste Reduced (OI7920). Organizations wishing to report on waste reductions achieved through the provision of services should report Waste Reductions from Services Sold (PI5678).

In some contexts, this metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Depth dimension of impact, which helps estimate the degree of change in outcome that the stakeholders experienced.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the average non-salaried wage paid to employees of the organization as a multiple of the local minimum wage during the reporting period. Organizations may use a variety of timeframes to calculate the average non-salaried wage (such as hourly, weekly, or daily) and should use the same time period when comparing wages to the local minimum. For example, if the minimum wage in a given area is based on an hourly rate, the average wage should also be hourly.

Organizations should footnote the source of the local minimum wage used to calculate this ratio. Organizations can refer to the definition of minimum wage in the glossary for more resources on where to find minimum wages by various geographies.

Organizations are encouraged to narrow the calculation of this ratio to specific geographies, industries, departments, or positions, and organizations should footnote details on how the calculation was done.

Worker safety entails placing and maintaining the worker in an environment adapted to the worker's physiological and psychological capabilities; preventing health-related departures caused by working conditions; promoting and maintaining the physical, mental, and social well-being of workers in all occupations; and protecting workers from health risks resulting from working conditions.

Examples of relevant policy details to footnote include: the process in place to assess safety risks, the frequency with which these risks are assessed, and the training and equipment provided to mitigate these risks.

Examples of training and equipment provided to mitigate worker safety risks include: safety training, required protective gear, testing of equipment, and posting of signs.

Organizations can refer to the SPI4 (http://cerise-spi4.squarespace.com/), specifically Essential Practice 5a5, for additional indicators related to worker safety. SPI4 is a social audit tool, developed for financial service providers, which can apply to any organization with both social and financial objectives.

    <cids:hasName xml:lang="en">Bias-Reducing Investment Practices</cids:hasName>
    <cids:hasDescription xml:lang="en">Describes practices the investing organization implemented during the reporting period to reduce biases in investment criteria, policies, and processes that have disproportionately negative effects on entrepreneurs who are from groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity. See usage guidance for specific practices to address.</cids:hasDescription>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including progress on shifting practices and what further practices the organization is considering changing.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to describe bias-reducing investing practices employed by investors during the reporting period.

Specific practices for asset owners to describe, when applicable, include the following, drawn from the Due Diligence 2.0 Commitment (https://www.duediligencecommitment.com/):
- Consideration of track record alternatives for fund managers, investment strategies, and investment products
- Expansion of relevant experience in evaluating stability of partnership with individual investment managers
- Evaluation of alternative proxies for financial stability of a manager, including (a) the manager’s history of operating effectively with lower than industry-standard budgets, (b) growth momentum in assets under management (AUM), (c) AUM growth in previous position(s) at prior firm(s), and (d) what happens to the underlying investments in the event of firm insolvency
- Minimization of requests for time by reducing asks for meeting time with historically marginalized managers and condensing, standardizing, and supporting managers with RFIs and RFPs
- Contextualization of fees
- Inclusion of historically unrecognized risks in analysis
- Investment as an anchor/seed investor or as part of a first close without lower fee requirement
- Provision of transparency on minimum thresholds and deal-breakers when circulating RFPs or RFIs
- Provision of clear, detailed, and timely feedback to historically marginalized managers who are rejected

Specific practices for direct investors to describe, when applicable, include the following, drawn in part from Path to 15|55’s  “How Usable Capital Will Unleash Black Business Growth” (https://www.pathto1555.org/_files/ugd/baac54_b384b1919ac848f4b25f37bd5bf69036.pdf):
- Consideration of alternatives to credit scores in assessing credit worthiness
- Consideration of alternatives to collateral and personal guarantees in underwriting
- Provision of interest rates based on ability to pay (rather than risk-based rates)
- Provision of terms including event-based repayment schedules
- Involvement of the local community in due diligence and investment decision-making
- Provision of flexible/patient capital to defray risk of commercial capital via loss reserves/subordinated positions

For further guidance, organizations (and especially asset owners) should consult the Due Diligence 2.0 Commitment (https://www.duediligencecommitment.com/), from which much of the above list is drawn.  While common biased practices are included above, the list is not comprehensive. Investing organizations are strongly encouraged to include an assessment of their investment terms, policies, and practices as part of their regular racial equity audits.

For further details on the specified practices in addition to the resources linked above, see the Curated Resources section of the IRIS+ Racial Equity Strategic Goal. This metric aligns with the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance’s (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/) Investor Blueprint for Racial Equity.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of employees earning an exact local minimum wage.

Minimum wage is the lowest wage permitted by law or by special agreement (such as with a labor union). Since the minimum wage varies with geography and context, IRIS does not define a minimum wage. Organizations can refer to the definition of minimum wage in the glossary for more resources on determining minimum wage(s) for the purposes of IRIS+ reporting.

Organizations interested in capturing living wage may instead use Employees Earning a Living Wage or Higher (OI4724).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

This metric includes both full- and part-time students. Each discrete student is counted once, regardless of the number of courses taken.

These data may be most effectively collected through either school reporting (for private schools) or government reporting (for public schools).

The population classified as low income includes all those who fall below a fixed threshold, which includes those classified as poor or very poor. Because assessing the poverty level of stakeholders is complex, organizations will likely use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether the organization completes any type of biodiversity measurement, from tailormade species inventories in the field to high-level modeling. Examples of information that such assessments may cover, which organizations should footnote, include: the species present in a given area, invasive species present, habitat conditions, overexploitation of natural resources, availability and quality of water resources, potential effect of production on adjacent crops, historical/archaeological importance of the land, impact of climate change or pollutions, or existence of regulations related to the site (e.g., catchments area, protected area).

Organizations are also encouraged to footnote details about the frequency and system with which they conduct their biodiversity assessments.

Various biodiversity measurement tools are available (for more information, see European Business &amp; Biodiversity Platform’s workstream on methods, https://ec.europa.eu/environment/biodiversity/business/workstreams/methods/index_en.htm). Organizations are encouraged, albeit with caution, to embrace innovative measurement approaches to improve accuracy.

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.

The level of application (e.g., project, site, or organization) and business context of the collected data will heavily inform the type of assessment performed. Examples of business context, to footnote, include screening on biodiversity risks, identifying restoration opportunities, tracking progress against targets (such as biodiversity no net loss or net gain), comparing investment options, and benchmarking.</skos:scopeNote>

For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the amount of time a service—for example, hours of electricity, running water, or internet service—is provided to clients during the reporting period. Organizations may use Product/Service Detailed Type (PD1516) to describe or disaggregate this metric by services provided. By comparing this metric to the total duration of the reporting period, organizations can estimate the quality of services provided.

Organizations are encouraged to use this metric in combination with Service Hours Interrupted (PI2230) to capture service outage rates.

For water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH investments), this metric is intended to capture how many hours of water are available as a result of the products or services provided by the organization. This metric is not designed to cover water provided over the lifetime of a product or service but rather only includes those hours of water made available during the reporting period.

This metric is aligned to the IBNET indicator 15.1, “Continuity of Service." The IBNET reporting format is average hours / day. These are administrative data and should come from the service provider.

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the total units or volume an organization purchased from certified supplier organizations during the reporting period. Certification must come from a third party, be based on transparent standards, and have an assurance process. The process of certification must be carried out by a recognized third-party body, independent from interested parties, which demonstrates that a product or organization complies with the requirements defined by the standards or technical specifications. Examples of such certifications include: UTZ Certified, Fair Trade (WFTO fair trade standard), Common Code for the Coffee Community (C4), Rainforest Alliance agriculture certification, Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

Organizations should footnote relevant details about the certification (such as certification name and certifying body) and can do so by reporting separately on Product/Service Certifications (PD2756).

Organizations that purchase different types of products/services should consider reporting separately against each different type of product/service.</skos:scopeNote>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique rural clients who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the socioeconomic details of the target stakeholders of the organization's activities. Organizations can benefit people and the planet throughout their supply and distribution chains, by providing products or services, and through their operations.

"Lower income" is defined according to a consumption-based approach to measuring poverty, specifically including individuals or households living below a recognized poverty line that establishes the minimum available expenditure that would meet a household’s basic needs. Organizations should prefer to define this threshold based on a national poverty line set by the national government. If such a benchmark is unavailable, organizations can use the international USD 3.20 per person per day expenditure at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), as defined by the World Bank. In either case, organizations should footnote their definition of the poverty threshold and its source.

"Lower middle-income" and "Upper middle-income" thresholds are defined per capita by the World Bank each year in PPP-adjusted current dollars (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mic/overview#1). Organizations should footnote the threshold used, the PPP adjustment applied, and any household size assumptions, if applicable.

If selecting the option "Other," organizations are encouraged to align to an existing, generally accepted standard or classification of the target socioeconomic group. If doing so, organizations should footnote the classification or standard used.

This metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">NOTE: This metric will be deprecated in a forthcoming update to the IRIS Catalog of Metrics. Users are advised to instead report Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) disaggregated by Active Use (PI7985).

This metric is intended to capture the number of unique clients who were active users of the organization’s services as of the end of the reporting period; this metric is more relevant to organizations providing services than to those providing products. Organizations wishing to report total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184) and related submetrics. Organizations wishing to report the number of unique clients during the course of the reporting period can report on Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

For financial institutions (including microfinance institutions), this metric would include the number of individuals who currently have outstanding loan balances with the organization. For those financial institutions offering deposit products, this metric would include the number of individuals who have active deposit accounts with the organization. For those financial institutions offering insurance products, this metric would include those with active insurance policies. In all cases, the reported number should be based on the number of individuals, rather than the number of groups or number of active policies/accounts.

The definition of active may vary by offering. For example, for traditional financial services, “active” may include all individuals who have accounts registered in their names for at least six months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior six months. For digital financial services, “active” may include individuals who have had accounts registered in their names for at least three months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior three months.

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/).

Distributors counted under this metric need not exclusively sell the organization’s products or services. Direct employees who distribute the organization's goods or services should be considered employees, not distributors.

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

Racial equity trainings are defined as those that explicitly focus on race and/or racism as a major factor in economic and social disparities in order to increase understanding of racism and its connection to financial markets.

Organizations are strongly encouraged to offer racial equity trainings (and many other types of trainings) in a series and on an ongoing basis—rather than in a single instance—in order to enable the reflection necessary for these to be successful. Further, while implicit bias trainings can form a useful part of antiracism trainings, such trainings should additionally aim to highlight both the systemic outcomes of implicit biases and actions that individuals and organizations can take to drive more equitable outcomes. For further guidance on racial equity trainings, see the Resources sections in the IRIS+ Racial Equity theme.

It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

Organizations operating in health services may find it beneficial to report with greater specificity the ages of their clients. For best practice guidelines for youth classification, see the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013/intro/keyterms/en/), which defines age ranges as follows: infant (birth to one year), child (one to 10 years), and adolescent (10 to 19 years).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

These are administrative data and should come from the service provider (for example, the utility company).

This metric, in combination with Water Provided for Sale: Total (PI9468), aligns with the IBNET indicator Non-Revenue Water (IBNET 6.1), which represents water that has been produced but is “lost” before it reaches the customer (whether through leaks, theft, or legal usage for which no payment is made). Some non-revenue water can be saved through appropriate technical and managerial actions. Water saved can then be used to meet currently unsatisfied demand (and hence to increase revenues to the utility) or to defer future capital expenditures in additional supply (and hence to reduce costs to the utility). For further detail, see IBNET (https://www.ib-net.org/toolkit/ibnet-indicators/non-revenue-water/).

This metric also aligns with HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicators for water and energy. To meet HIPSO specifications for water, users should disaggregate this metric by commercial and technical losses.

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the amount of greenhouse gases emitted indirectly by the organization from the generation of purchased energy during the reporting period. For tools that may be helpful in calculating this and related metrics, see GHG Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools).

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions, defines indirect emissions as emissions that result from the activities of the reporting entity but that occur at sources owned or controlled by other entities.

The GHG Protocol further categorizes indirect emissions into "Scope 2" and "Scope 3." Scope 2 includes GHG emissions resulting from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam. Scope 3 includes indirect emissions such as the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport-related activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities (e.g., Transition and Distribution [T&amp;D] losses) not covered in Scope 2, outsourced activities, and waste disposal, among other sources. For more information on the GHG Protocol, organizations should refer to the following:
the following:
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards)
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools)

In the context of this metric, indirect emissions refer to GHG emissions from the generation of electricity, heat, or steam that is imported and consumed by the reporting organization.

Organizations are also encouraged to report Greenhouse Gas Emissions Strategy (OI8237).</skos:scopeNote>

In an example of how this metric might be calculated, suppose a school begins the day at 8:00am and ends at 2:00pm. Each day approximately one hour is spent on lunch, breaks, or other non-classroom learning time. Therefore, each day, each student is offered five hours of instruction. Students attend school five days per week. The reporting organization would then report 5 × 5 = 25 hours.

This metric differs from Learning Hours (PI1836) in that this metric captures school time offered, while Learning Hours (PI1836) captures actual time provided. For example, if a calculation as above yields 25 hours for this metric, but within the reporting period school was cancelled for four hours in total because of snow or other bad weather, in that case would Learning Hours (PI1836) = (25 hours × number of weeks in the reporting period) - 4 hours.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique low-income households that received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. Examples of organizations that might report against this metric include those that provide products such as clean cookstoves or water purification systems and those that provide services such as home weatherization. Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

The population classified as low income includes all those who fall below a fixed threshold, which includes those classified as poor or very poor. Because assessing the poverty level of clients is complex, organizations will likely use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including source(s) of data.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether the organization expanded its operations to cover a greater share of a market in which it was previously active, potentially measuring the organization’s contribution to competition in that existing market.

This metric should not be confused with New Market Entered (OI3441), which applies to organizations that have just entered the relevant market. Only one of these two indicators can apply to an organization at any one time for the same market.

The organization should define and footnote “Dominant” and “Concentrated” based on the context in which it operates. For example, in some markets, a dominant firm may have over 50% market share while, in another, a firm may be dominant with just 20% share. Market concentration is determined by the number of firms in a market and their respective shares of the relevant market. Hence, a “concentrated” market typically features fewer firms with larger market shares, with or without a dominant player.

International Finance Institutions (IFIs) often use this metric as part of their analysis of private sector development.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This disaggregation, applied to another metric, is intended to capture the share of that metric which is considered in or participating in active use.

For example, for financial institutions (including microfinance institutions), the disaggregation "active" applied to Client Individuals (PI4060) would include the number of individuals who currently have outstanding loan balances with the organization. For those financial institutions offering deposit products, the disaggregation "active" applied to Client Individuals (PI4060) would include the number of individuals who have active deposit accounts with the organization. For those financial institutions offering insurance products, the disaggregation "active" applied to Client Individuals (PI4060) would include those with active insurance policies. Wherever possible, organizations are encouraged to report and disaggregate the number of individuals, rather than the number of active groups or the number of active policies/accounts.

The definition of active may vary by offering. For example, for traditional financial services, “active” may include all individuals who have accounts registered in their names for at least six months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior six months. For digital financial services, “active” may include individuals who have had accounts registered in their names for at least three months and who have used their accounts to make transactions within the prior three months.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations can benefit people and planet throughout their supply and distribution chains, in their provision of products or services, and through their operations. Some examples follow:
- An organization that produces wind power from wind farms, mitigating climate change, could indicate the planet as its target stakeholder.
- An organization buying mangoes from co-operatives that source from smallholder farmers could indicate suppliers as its target stakeholder.
- An organization that recruits, trains, and employs chronically underemployed populations could indicate employees as its target stakeholder.
- An organization engaging women in poor rural areas as distributors of its products and services could indicate distributors as its target stakeholder.
- An organization manufacturing and selling water purification tablets could indicate clients as its target stakeholder.

Organizations are encouraged to report IRIS metrics related to numbers reached and other key performance indicators (KPIs). For instance, the example organization above that buys mangoes might also report Supplier Individuals: Smallholder (PI9991) and Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder (PI7852).

Organizations are also encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Relationship to Target Stakeholders (OD7900).

For planet-related stakeholders, organizations are encouraged to use this metric in conjunction with Target Stakeholder Ecoregion (PD2854), Target Stakeholder Setting (PD6384), Target Area Protected Status (PD1676), and Target Stakeholder Geography (PD6424).

This metric may help describe the WHO dimension of impact, which details which stakeholders the investment or enterprise aims to reach with the outcome. This metric may also help clarify how underserved they were prior to the investment.

No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the reduction in water usage resulting from the organization’s water conservation during the report period. Water conservation efforts could include low-flow toilets, rainwater collection facilities, or improved manufacturing processes. Organizations should not include overall reduced water usage resulting from reduced organizational activities (e.g., partial outsourcing of operations).

Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including the basis for calculating reductions in water usage (such as base year or baseline) and the rationale for choosing that basis. For example, if the reporting period is annual, organizations should report on the difference in water use between the current year and previous year. Additionally, organizations are encouraged to footnote water conserved as a percentage of the total water consumed by the organization.

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Water Conservation Strategy (OI9326).

In some contexts, this metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Depth dimension of impact, which helps estimate the degree of change in outcome that the stakeholders experienced. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

Surface water occurs naturally on the Earth’s surface in the form of ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams. For further details, see the IRIS+ glossary term. This metric applies to organizations sourcing their water directly from an above-ground water body rather than from a water service provider. This metric, as well as other metrics calculated using Water Withdrawn (OI0263) and Water Discharged (OI0386), can be used in conjunction with Water Type (OD7536) to describe water consumption in more detail.

For further guidance on water uses, see the Alliance for Water Efficiency (http://www.allianceforwaterefficiency.org).

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact).

Direct control refers to land for which the organization controls land use through direct operation or management, including situations in which the organization's employees cultivate the land directly. Note that land ownership is not always equivalent to control. For example, where land is leased to another entity or individual to cultivate (e.g., a third-party manager), land is only directly controlled if the lease is accompanied by exhaustive criteria for land use.

Such land-use criteria are often included in management plans and legal agreements that also incorporate sustainability principles and typically include termination provisions in the event of poor performance. To the extent that the third-party manager must make minimal, ad-hoc, and discretionary land-use decisions that fall outside the scope of the land-use criteria, the land may still be considered directly controlled by the organization.</skos:scopeNote>

This metric is sourced from GRI Disclosure 403-10: Work-related Ill Health in GRI 403: Occupational Health and Safety 2018. Per GRI guidance, ‘Ill health’ indicates damage to health and includes diseases, illnesses, and disorders. The terms ‘disease,’ ‘illness,’ and ‘disorder,’ often used interchangeably, refer to conditions with specific symptoms and diagnoses. Work-related injuries and ill health are those that arise from exposure to hazards at work. Other types of incidents can occur that are not connected with the work itself. For more guidance, see GRI Disclosure 403-10 (https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/media/1910/gri-403-occupational-health-and-safety-2018.pdf).</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the percentage of patients who received treatment that they needed during the reporting period.
The denominator of this calculation is the number of clients who needed treatment during the reporting period.

Examples of interventions to which this metric might apply include the following:

- Percentage of pregnant patients who attended required antenatal care visits during the reporting period.
- Percentage of patients who received counseling during the reporting period.

Healthcare Crude Coverage (PI3902) is an input into Healthcare Effective Coverage (PI7191) – crude coverage is a simple measure of percent of patients needing treatment who received it during the reporting period, while effective coverage includes a measure of quality. Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. For further details on these measures and practical application in the investment context, see IADB’s "The Use of Effective Coverage in the Evaluation of Maternal and Child Health Programs: A Technical Note for the IDB’s Social Protection and Health” (https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Use-of-Effective-Coverage-in-the-Evaluation-of-Maternal-and-Child-Health-Programs-A-Technical-Note-for-the-IDB-Social-Protection-and-Health-Division.pdf) and “Effective coverage as a new approach to health system performance assessment: a scoping review” (https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3692-7). For background on the measure itself, see “Access, utilization, quality, and effective coverage: an integrated conceptual framework and measurement strategy” (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953604006070?via%3Dihub).

In specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric, used in combination with Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752), is intended to capture the number of client organizations that are led by persons of specific groups. For example, this metric can support calculations of the percentage of a portfolio invested in companies led by women or by individuals from groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity.

Leader(s) counted must retain an active role in the organization as of the end of the reporting period. An active role may include acting in an advisory capacity for key decisions and does not necessarily require a full-time role at the organization.

Typically, this metric refers to the CEO of the company. If the company is led by multiple people, at least 51% of the leaders must be from the specified group in order to be considered "led" by that group.

Organizations focusing this metric on groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity must define that group according to context. For example, in the United States, organizations might focus on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). In South Africa, organizations might focus on Black African, Coloured, and Indian or Asian Individuals. In all contexts, when defining these groups, organizations must consider local history and context.

These data can often be collected from the human resources department, though for accuracy organizations should ensure that data on racial and ethnic background are self-reported.

Used along with Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to specify historically marginalized groups due to race and/or ethnicity, this metric aligns with the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance’s (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/) Investor Blueprint for Racial Equity and its corporate-focused CEO Blueprint for Racial Equity (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/2021-blueprint).</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture a proxy measure of product/service quality and target stakeholder satisfaction. A target stakeholder can be a client, employee, or anyone the organization is aiming to have a positive impact on, and is called a "beneficiary" by some organizations.

This metric can also be understood as a Net Promoter Score. For further information and guidance on this calculation, see NetPromoter.com. Organizations can use the question "How likely is it that you would recommend \[product/service\] to a friend or colleague?" to collect data from target stakeholders against this metric. Respondents should rank their likelihood to recommend on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing "not at all likely to recommend," 10 representing "extremely likely to recommend,"and 5 representing "neutral." Target stakeholders ranking themselves as a 9 or 10 are considered "extremely likely" or "Promoters." Target stakeholders ranking themselves as a 7 or 8 are considered "Passives." Target stakeholders ranking themselves as 0-6 are considered "unlikely" or "Detractors."

Users may report this metric with Client Feedback System (OI5049) as the system by which this feedback is solicited.

In specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see specific guidance document. No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations should report this metric in combination with Availability of Basic Services/Facilities (PI0617) to capture the availability or quality of services provided. To capture the number of individuals who have improved access to and use of WASH services, organizations should report this metric in combination with Client Individuals: Provided New Access (PI2575) and Service Level Type (PD5205).

Organizations may choose to disaggregate sanitation facilities by sewered and non-sewered offerings.

For further definitions and details on what each type of WASH services includes and requires, organizations can refer to the criteria set forth in the Joint Monitoring Programme's Service Ladder for Handwashing (https://washdata.org/monitoring). For example, for menstrual hygiene waste disposal, mechanisms can include incineration or another safe method on-site, as well as safe storage and collection via a municipal waste system, as appropriate.</skos:scopeNote>

The benchmark price is the average price that can be obtained for a similar product/service in the local area.

An example of how this metric might be calculated follows. By selling to the organization, farmers get USD 2 per pound for a good (such as apples) compared to only USD 1 per pound for selling the same good in the local market. The reporting organization would report this as (USD 2 – USD 1) / USD 1 x 100 = 100% and would footnote assumptions with regard to how they derived the local market rate (that is, the benchmark).

In some circumstances, this metric can help describe the CONTRIBUTION an organization likely had to the degree of change (depth) in outcome that the stakeholders experienced, relative to what the market or social system would have done anyway.

For example, if the organization constructs a new road and, in the process, displaces 50 people, the value of this metric would be 50. Organizations should footnote details of the displacement.

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Individuals Displaced: Compensated (PI3009) to identify the number of displaced individuals who received remuneration for their displacement. For more on this topic, see EBRD’s Resettlement Guidance and Best Practice (https://www.ebrd.com/publications/resettlement-guidance-good-practice.pdf).

This metric may most apply to projects involving the construction or renovation of large-scale infrastructure, as well as building projects.

This metric is often used by International Finance Institutions (IFIs) as part of infrastructure analysis.

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

Such projects can include efficiency improvements to lighting (lower-usage or fewer fixtures), increased building performance through improved insulation, installation of energy-efficient windows, and increased heating/cooling or appliance efficiency.

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with the Energy Conserved (OI6697) as a result of these improvements. Organizations wishing to report on the amount of money spent on renewable energy infrastructure and technology, which may lead to the energy-efficiency improvements reported here, can use Renewable Energy Capital Expenditures (OI9206). If the energy-efficiency improvements are part of a wider energy conservation strategy or as otherwise applicable, organizations are also encouraged to report Energy Conservation Strategy (OI4531).</skos:scopeNote>

This metric is intended to capture non-renewable energy generated for commercial sale by the organization. Bulk energy is usually sold under a power purchase agreement with an electricity utility. The buyer or purchaser of this energy is termed the offtaker.

Non-renewable energy sources include coal, natural gas, and crude oil derivatives, among other forms. Organizations may refer to the glossary for additional information.

Organizations wishing to report on the amount of non-renewable energy generated for their own use should report Energy Generated for Use: Non-Renewable (OI1495).

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including their categorization of historically marginalized groups. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique clients who belong to a group historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity and who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

    <cids:hasName xml:lang="en">Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scopes</cids:hasName>
    <cids:hasDescription xml:lang="en">Describes the applicable types of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted as a result of the organization's operations during the reporting period.

Choose all that apply:

- Scope 1/Direct Emissions (emissions from owned or controlled sources)
- Scope 2/Indirect Emissions (emissions from purchased energy)
- Scope 3/Indirect and direct emissions across the organization’s value chain</cids:hasDescription>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including source of data.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the different types of greenhouse gas emissions reported.

The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions, categorizes direct and indirect emissions into three broad scopes.
Scope 1/Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity.
Scope 2/Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that result from the activities of the reporting entity but that occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity.
Scope 3 GHG emissions are emitted directly and indirectly by actors across the organization's value chain.

For more information on the GHG Protocol, organizations should refer to the following:
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards)
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools)

GHG emissions resulting from land use, changes in land use, bioenergy, and related topics can be reported in conjunction with indirect emissions across the organization's value chain.

Organizations can use this metric in conjunction with Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Total (OI1479) to detail the GHG emissions for a specific scope. For GHG related to products, organizations may report Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Product (PD9427) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Product Replaced (PD2243).</skos:scopeNote>

This metric is intended to capture the amount of non-renewable energy produced and used by the organization itself. For example, if an organization builds its own natural gas plant and uses this generated energy for its factories, it would report the amount of energy produced and used from that source under this metric.

Non-renewable energy sources include coal, natural gas, and crude oil derivatives, among other forms. Organizations may refer to the glossary for additional information.

Organizations wishing to report on the amount of renewable energy generated for sale should report Energy Generated for Sale: Renewable (PI5842).

This metric is intended to capture renewable energy generated for commercial sale by the organization. Bulk energy is usually sold under a power purchase agreement with an electricity utility. The buyer or purchaser of this energy is termed the offtaker.

Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, geothermal, hydro energy, and biomass, among other forms. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information.

Large-scale hydropower is often excluded from the definition of renewable energy. Although water itself is a renewable resource, the natural ecology of rivers is not, and hydroelectric dams can adversely affect aquatic ecosystems. Organizations can refer to the Low Impact Hydropower Institute (http://lowimpacthydro.org) for further guidance on creating low-impact hydropower operations.

Organizations wishing to report on the amount of renewable energy generated for the organization's own use should instead report Energy Generated for Use: Renewable (OI2496).

Organizations may use the IRIS metric Stakeholder Engagement (OI7914) to understand the mechanisms used to obtain input from stakeholders regarding the design, development, and delivery of products and services.

This metric should be part of the measurement and description of the WHAT dimension of impact, as it helps describe how important the outcome is for affected stakeholders. For more on using IRIS+ to capture stakeholder voice, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

- Gender: 30% female or gender non-binary in senior leadership (C-suite) or on the Board or Investment Committee, following the 2X Challenge criteria (https://www.2xchallenge.org/criteria).

This disaggregation, applied to another metric, is intended to capture the share of that metric which relates to the selected demographic groups in leadership. For example, when applied to Client Organizations (PI9652), this disaggregation would capture the number of client organizations with leadership in the selected demographic group(s).

Individuals in leadership should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the volume of water from high-water-stress regions used within the organization for any purpose, including but not limited to productive processes (for example, packaging and manufacturing), human consumption, and agricultural purposes. Organizations are encouraged to footnote the percentage of their total water use that represents water use from regions with high or extremely high baseline water stress.

To calculate this metric (water consumed), subtract the amount of Water Discharged (OI0386) to high-water-stressed areas from the amount of Water Withdrawn (OI0263) from high-water-stressed areas. Report Level of Water Stress (OI2799) to disaggregate land managed by the organization by water stress. For this calculation, organizations should consider “High” or “Extremely High” water stress under Level of Water Stress (OI2799) to be “high water stress.”

Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the organization, wastewater obtained from other entities, municipal water supply, or supply from other water utilities.

Baseline water stress is total water withdrawal as a percentage of freshwater availability in a specific water source. High water stress is defined as a percentage of 40–80%, and extremely high is defined as a percentage greater than 80%. Organizations can refer to the glossary for further guidance on identifying high or extremely high baseline water stress regions. Organizations may also consult resources such as the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Risk Atlas Tool (http://www.wri.org/resources/maps/aqueduct-water-risk-atlas) and the WWF-DEG Water Risk Filter (http://waterriskfilter.panda.org/).

Target stakeholder (or client) engagement strategies involve intentional approaches to align the design and provision of products and services with the priorities of target stakeholders.

    <cids:hasDescription xml:lang="en">Net number of new, full-time equivalent employees living in low-income areas and working for enterprises directly financed or supported by the organization during the reporting period.

Many organizations select the beginning of the reporting period as the time when the organization began its support or investment.</cids:hasDescription>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including how they identify low-income areas. Organizations that report data for more than one reporting period should be careful to very clearly footnote which they are using for this metric. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations and in low-income areas during the reporting period.

Organizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.”

The three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on defining low-income areas.

Direct jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).

While this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.

If there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.

Organizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

In educational contexts, clients can refer to students. In health care contexts, clients refers to patients, and in housing contexts, clients refers to residents or tenants.

A complaint tracking system is a way for clients to provide feedback, ask questions, and file complaints that is broadly recognized and promoted by the organization and of which most or all clients/customers are aware. Examples, which should be footnoted, may include products that have an email address or phone number for customer feedback listed on their packaging, an organization that has a client feedback link displayed on its website, or an organization that includes a client feedback number on its invoices or contract agreements. With respect to the resolution of complaints, organizations should footnote their system for tracking how and when complaints were addressed.

Organizations should consider reporting this metric in conjunction with Complaints Ratio (PI5216) and Number of Complaints Registered (PI2197).

In educational contexts, this metric can be used to indicate whether the school or program has a system for receiving student reports about bullying and addressing those complaints.

In South Africa, organizations might focus on Black African, Coloured, and Indian or Asian individuals. In all contexts, organizations must consider local history and context in their definition.

These data can often be collected from the human resources department, though for accuracy organizations should ensure that data on racial and ethnic background are self-reported.

Used along with Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to specify historically marginalized groups due to race and/or ethnicity, this metric aligns with the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance’s (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/) Investor Blueprint for Racial Equity and its corporate-focused CEO Blueprint for Racial Equity (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/2021-blueprint).</skos:scopeNote>

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.</skos:scopeNote>

Examples of organizations that might report against this metric include those that provide products such as clean cookstoves or water purification systems and those that provide services such as home weatherization. Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

Because assessing the poverty level of client households is complex, organizations will likely have to use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold.

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture how much wastewater derived from an organization's productive or operational processes is treated.

Wastewater, or water that carries wastes, is usually a mixture of water and dissolved or suspended solids. Treatment aims to improve the quality of the wastewater before the remaining water is discharged back to the environment by reducing suspended solids, biodegradable organics, pathogenic bacteria, and nutrients. Wastewater treatment typically takes place over three levels: primary (mechanical), secondary (biological), and tertiary. Organizations may further specify the wastewater's level of treatment by disaggregating this metric by Water Treatment Level (OI9278).

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the volume of traffic in a particular market or context, expressed as the average number of vehicles using an urban road per day over the course of a year. Organizations may also choose to report average traffic for other periods of time (e.g., traffic per month). Traffic on a road, particularly over time, serves as a proxy for the qualitative contribution of new transportation infrastructure to economic activity.

Providers of GPS traffic data frequently offer traffic counts by side of road, day of week, and time of day.

International Finance Institutions (IFIs) often use this metric as part of transportation analysis. If toll roads are not part of a project, this metric is not a good indicator of impact performance, unless the corresponding transport or transit agency monitors traffic congestion.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including details about the position used in the calculation. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the disparity—if any—between employees from groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity compared to other employees who are not from groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. If the average wages paid to both groups on average were the same, the ratio would be 1. Organizations should use Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to disaggregate these groups.

This ratio can be calculated based on salaried employees with fixed wages or on employees with variable salaries (such as hourly, daily, weekly, other specified time cycle, or other specified parameter).

Organizations should footnote the specific position used in calculating this ratio, including whether the position is a managerial or non-managerial role. Organizations reporting this metric for multiple positions are encouraged to report these various data points for historically marginalized wage equity and to specify the position to which each data point corresponds.

While this metric helps organizations begin to understand historically marginalized wage equity in their operations, organizations are cautioned that other factors may affect the data collected. For example, the average wages reported for this metric may only be meaningful if multiple individuals both within and without groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity have similar positions within the organization. Employee education, experience, and tenure at the organization, among other factors, may also influence wage disparities.

This metric excludes Temporary Employees (OI9028).

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional guidance on defining management. The composition of management varies with an organization’s stage and type, but managers are generally responsible for setting objectives (defining goals for the group and deciding what work must be done to meet those goals), organizing (dividing work into manageable activities and selecting the right people to accomplish them), motivating and communicating (creating a team out of individuals through decisions on pay, promotion, and communications), measuring (establishing targets and interpreting and analyzing performance), and developing people.

The categorization of groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether an organization has a forest management plan (FMP), which delineates the technical application of appropriate forestry principles, practices, and business techniques to manage a forest in pursuit of the landowner's objectives.

Organizations' FMPs typically include information about land tenure, existing designation and land use, landowners' goals and objectives, location (including limits and bounds), protection and maintenance activities, inventory data, and proscribed activities. FMPs also typically outline a Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system that collects and monitors such data as the yield of forest products harvested; the growth rates, regeneration, and condition of the forest; the composition and observed changes in the resident flora and fauna; the environmental and social impacts of harvesting and other operations; and the costs, productivity, and efficiency of forest management. FMPs may also include a requirement to conduct an Environmental &amp; Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to assess, for example, High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests.

Examples of FMP details, to footnote, may include: what information is included in the FMP, whether the plan has been approved by national authorities, whether the organization regularly submits its reports to the relevant national authorities, whether the organization has a team in charge of its implementation, whether the plan is applied as a guide in annual harvesting or collecting operations, whether the plan is reviewed regularly (and at what interval), and whether the plan’s implementation is verified by a third party.

Organizations are encouraged, where applicable, to report this metric in conjunction with Land Directly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (OI6912) and Land Indirectly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (PI6796).

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique poor clients who received the organization's products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

Because assessing the poverty level of stakeholders is complex, organizations will likely use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

Examples of such certifications include: UTZ Certified, Fair Trade (WFTO fair trade standard), Common Code for the Coffee Community (C4), Rainforest Alliance agriculture certification, Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

Organizations should footnote relevant details about the certification (such as certification name and certifying body) and can do so by reporting separately on Product/Service Certifications (PD2756).

Organizations that sell different types of products/services should consider reporting separately against each different product/service.</skos:scopeNote>

HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) users should disaggregate from this metric the length of road that increases access to the network for non-motorized forms of transport.

Organizations should only report the length of road for which construction has already been completed, not that financed and still under construction.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture jobs at all financed or directly supported enterprises as of the end of the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects.

Organizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Supported (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party and directly related to operations and maintenance of company.” To align to the HIPSO indicator Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction), organizations should include only the data for Jobs Type (OD0660) options “Permanence: Temporary (One-Time)” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through third-party, but not directly related to operations and maintenance of company.”

The three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.

Direct jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).

While this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.

If there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.

This metric may help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture information about the small and medium-sized enterprises that supply goods or services to the reporting organization.

Organizations should not include subcontractors as part of this metric; subcontractors can be reported under Temporary Employees (OI9028) and its related submetrics.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Organizations may use this metric to screen for appropriate working hours at directly supported/financed enterprises or small and medium-size enterprise (SME) clients. Given complexity of measuring hours worked by employees of SME client organizations, checking for a policy in place is a good alternative. This metric is focused on employees’ working hours. For polices related to safety and working conditions of employees, refer to Worker Safety Policy (OI8001)

Examples of relevant policy details to footnote include: the process in place to assess safety risks, the frequency with which the risks are assessed, and the training and equipment provided to mitigate these risks.

Worker safety includes placing and maintaining the worker in an environment adapted to the worker's physiological and psychological capabilities, preventing health-related departures caused by working conditions, promoting and maintaining the physical, mental, and social well-being of workers in all occupations, and protecting workers from health risks resulting from working conditions.
Organizations can refer to the SPI4 (&lt;http://cerise-spi4.squarespace.com/&gt;), specifically the Essential Practice 5a5, for additional indicators related to worker safety. SPI4 is a social audit tool developed for financial service providers but applicable to any organization that has both social and financial objectives.

This metric aligns with GRI Disclosure 403-8: Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system.</skos:scopeNote>

- Race/Ethnicity: 50% from a historically marginalized groups, by analogue to Gender.

This disaggregation, applied to another metric, is intended to capture the share of that metric which relates to the selected demographic groups among founders. For example, when applied to Client Organizations (PI9652), this disaggregation would capture the number of client organizations founded by members of the selected demographic group(s).

Founders should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations should count all companies in the pipeline at any point in the reporting period, regardless of whether or not investment or the investment process proceeded.

Organizations focusing this metric on groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity must define that group according to context. For example, in the United States, organizations might focus on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). In South Africa, organizations might focus on Black African, Coloured, and Indian or Asian Individuals. In all contexts, when defining these groups, organizations must consider local history and context.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the total amount of GHG emissions sequestered during the reporting period. Organizations should use this metric in combination with Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation Types (OI9839) in order to disaggregate the types of GHG emissions sequestered that are relevant to the organization's activities. This metric refers to GHG emissions sequestered during the reporting period, not over the lifetime of trees or forestland, for example.

Greenhouse gas emissions are anthropogenic drivers of climate change, which alters species’ habitats. Species that cannot migrate or adapt become extinct, leading to worldwide decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Restoring carbon sinks such as forests and peatlands can help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon.

Calculating GHG emissions sequestration is technical and requires standardized, precise methodological guidance. Organizations should refer to at least one of the following standards when calculating this metric: Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, AFOLU Carbon Calculator, Climate Action Reserve Standard, and Plan Vivo Standard. For tools that may be helpful in calculating this and related metrics, see the GHG Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the adoption or operationalization of innovative business practices, ranging from financial structuring of the organization to the business processes it uses to deliver its products and services, as well as innovation in products. Products captured under this metric can be both physical goods and financial products.

“Operating geography and sector” can refer to a national market in small countries and regional markets in larger countries.

Organizations are encouraged to footnote the type of innovation adopted or operationalized, as well as the rationale for such an adoption or operationalization being considered innovation. Innovations in supplier or client relationships are better covered by Market Linkages Improved or Expanded (OI0685).

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique clients who received the organization's products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

- The institution's collection practices are covered during the initial training of all employees involved in collections (loan officers, collections employees, and branch managers). In particular, collections employees receive training in acceptable debt collections practices and loan recovery procedures.
- The institution documents and communicates to clients about loan policies and procedures for rescheduling credit.

Organizations should include only those clients who were placed in and began jobs during the reporting period and exclude clients who were placed in jobs but did not begin work.

For work integrating social enterprises (WISE), a high job placement rate is an indicator of success. High rates of voluntary turnover can also be an indicator of success along these lines, which organizations can capture using Employee Voluntary Turnover Rate (OI1638).

Organizations are also encouraged to provide details on the types of activities they conducted to increase job placement rates, such as (but not limited to): monitoring workforce trends to ensure alignment between program offerings and workforce needs, surveying employers (to capture position offerings, skills needed, and likely wages), strengthening relationships with potential employers, providing resources (such as interview tips, career fairs, and job leads) to assist job searches and career development, and creating program alumni networks.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the value of products for the insured. As an example, a 70% incurred claims ratio means that for every USD 100 of premium earned in a given accounting period, USD 70 is paid back to insured in the form of benefits (claims).

Incurred claims ratios should not be compared across different product types or at different stages of a product’s life cycle.

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote relevant details about their theory of change and whether it is publicly disseminated. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the organization’s theory of change. A theory of change (also referred to as a Theory of Value Creation or Logic Model) expresses the sequence of cause-and-effect actions or occurrences by which organizational and financial resources are hypothesized to convert into the desired social and environmental results. It provides a conceptual roadmap for how an organization expects to achieve its intended impact. Often displayed in a diagram, many theories of change can be expressed as a series of if–then statements, specifying what the organization does and the expected results of each activity. A framework built around the concepts of activities, inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts is called a Logic Model or Impact Value Chain. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information and resources.

Wherever possible, organizations’ theories of change should refer to relevant IRIS metrics.

Organizations are encouraged to footnote information on the defined outcomes they seek to achieve for their targeted stakeholders (e.g., clients, employees, distributors, suppliers, and/or the environment). Defined outcomes include specific targets that can be measured. Many are based on existing literature. Organizations are encouraged to footnote information on the evidence base that substantiates the logic chain linking outputs to defined outcomes. This evidence base might include credible secondary research, randomized control trials (RCT), longitudinal studies, primary research (such as customer surveys or stakeholder feedback forums), and qualitative interviews or case studies.

For example, an organization that provides training to and sources from smallholder farmers might only report on the number of farmers trained (Individuals Trained: Total [PI2998]), the number of smallholder farmers sourced from (Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI9991]), and the total payments made to those farmers (Payments to Supplier Individuals: Smallholder [PI7852]). However, its theory of change might describe how these outputs lead to outcomes, such as helping farmers build larger and more productive farms, and impacts, such as improved livelihoods, pointing to external research that supports this connection.</skos:scopeNote>

Examples of social risks to footnote, if relevant, include: mission drift, reputational risk, incidents resulting in harm to clients, client exit, employee dissatisfaction, incentives that can lead to negative behaviors among employees, lack of transparency, negative environmental impacts, gender inequalities and/or discrimination, and lack of implementation of policies, among others.

Examples of environmental risks to footnote, if relevant, include: license to operate, reputational risk, incidents resulting in harm to client or the environment (e.g., hazardous waste spills), negative social risks, risks to supply chain sustainability and  security, regulatory risk, and climate risk, among others.

Organizations are also encouraged to footnote the frequency with which they assess social and environmental performance risks and whether their risk management procedures reflect social and environmental risk criteria.

Organizations can refer to the Smart Campaign's Client Protection Principles (www.smartcampaign.org) and the indicators in the Green Module of the SPI4 (http://cerise-spi4.squarespace.com/) for further guidance.

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of grievances that were formally resolved through the organization's employee grievance mechanism during the reporting period. This metric does not capture the total number of grievances registered during the reporting period, which should be reported under Number of Employee Grievances Registered (OI1042). To capture whether the organization has an employee grievance and feedback system in general, organizations should use Employee Feedback and Grievance System (OI3601).

Organizations are also encouraged to footnote the ownership of the mechanism, the purpose of the mechanism and its relationship to other grievance mechanisms, the organization’s activities that are covered by the mechanism, the intended users of the mechanism, how the mechanism is managed, the process to address and resolve grievances (including how decisions are made), and the effectiveness criteria used (see GRI 103-2).

Effective grievance mechanisms should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, rights-compatible, and a source of continuous learning (GRI 2018). For operational-level mechanisms to be effective, they should be based on engagement and dialogue. For a description of each of these criteria, see Guiding Principle 31. United Nations (UN), ‘Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework,’ 2011.

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

Training can be categorized as: (a) skills-based training to advance core job responsibilities (enhancing employees' ability to do their jobs effectively); (b) skills-based training on cross-job functions (training beyond regular job responsibilities, enabling employees' to advance in their professions); (c) training on literacy, communications, and other life skills; or (d) trainings related to diversity and inclusion (for example, training on implicit bias or sexual harassment). Organizations should footnote details on the training(s) provided, including the type.

This metric is useful in calculating GRI Disclosure 404-1: Average hours of training per year per employee. In the context of this GRI standard, ‘training’ refers to all types of vocational training and instruction, paid educational leave provided by an organization for its employees, training or education pursued externally and paid for in whole or in part by an organization, and training on specific topics. Training does not include on-site coaching by supervisors.

Organizations may use Full-Time Employees: Total (OI3160) and Part-Time Employees: Total (OI8864) to disaggregate this metric. Organizations are also encouraged to calculate this indicator for Temporary Employees (OI9028). Organizations may choose to use Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to disaggregate this metric by gender, race/ethnicity, disability, or other groupings.</skos:scopeNote>

Since certifications vary by sector (for example, construction, textiles or manufacturing, agribusiness, supply chain development), organizations should disclose the type of certification held, as well as whether the certification is issued by an internationally recognized certifying authority and, if so, which one.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the product-lifetime energy savings to consumers as a result of energy-efficient products sold by the organization. For example, an organization that sells compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) that replace incandescent light bulbs might report this metric to capture the total energy savings to its clients resulting from the products provided. This metric captures the lifetime energy savings of products sold.

When multiplying the energy savings from each product sold by Units/Volume Sold: Total (PI1263), organizations should, under Units/Volume Sold: Total (PI1263), use the absolute number of product units sold rather than the volume of energy savings delivered by the product.

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture detailed information on the traceability system in place but does not evaluate the success with which that system is implemented.

A traceability system enables organizations to follow the original source(s) of raw materials and their routes to the organization by tracing, tracking, and certifying materials at all stages of production, from extraction to markets. Many organizations use traceability systems to reduce illegal activities (e.g., illegal logging, mining, or wildlife trade). This metric is most applicable to organizations operating in forestry, minerals, extractives, animal products, healthcare, or agriculture, among other industries.

Examples of details to footnote regarding traceability systems may include: the level to which raw materials are traceable (e.g., country, province, district, or exact location within a few kilometers’ radius), protocol documents, generated reports, and third-party verification and certification.

Organizations can use Product/Service Certifications (PD2756) to report any relevant certifications resulting from the traceability system.

For further guidance, organizations can refer to The Global Language of Business (http://www.gs1.org/traceability).</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the enrollment, progress, and transitions of students served by the organization during the reporting period. Used alone, it describes the schooling status of students in projects supported by the organization. Alternatively, or in addition, it may be used to disaggregate other metrics, such as Client Individuals: Total (PI4060), to capture the number of students with each status.

This metric helps organizations capture pupil-flow rates. For more on this concept, see UNESCO's Learning Portal (https://learningportal.iiep.unesco.org/en/glossary/pupil-flow-rates).

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations should footnote practices employed on, for example, agricultural land over which they have direct control. See glossary definition of directly controlled (land area) for more information. Organizations can report this metric in conjunction with Land Directly Controlled: Total (OI5408) and related submetrics.

Examples of water quality practices, to footnote, include the creation of buffer zones (particularly for native species); responsible management of manure, sewage, and fertilizer; and water-quality assessment.</skos:scopeNote>

A warranty is a type of guarantee that an organization makes regarding the condition of its product or effectiveness of its service. It also refers to the terms by and situations in which repairs or exchanges will be made in the event that the product/service does not function as originally described or intended.

Warranties will likely describe for how long the warranty is valid, the point of contact for receiving the warranty service, the service provided upon receiving the warranty (e.g., product replacement), what the warranty does and does not cover, and any conditions and limitations of the warranty.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations should use the average wage for the specific position analyzed. To source data points for average wages paid to employees in comparable positions at similar organizations, organizations can refer to resources issued by independent, third-party research bodies within their respective countries of operation. For example, organizations operating in the United States may refer to wage data by area and occupation published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm).

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the percentage of students at a school receiving free or reduced-price school meals funded, not by the organization itself, but rather by a third-party institution or program (such as a government program). Therefore, the students are not considered clients receiving free products from the organization.

Both full- and part-time students should be included in this calculation, if applicable, with each discrete student counted once regardless of the number of courses taken.

This metric is frequently used as a proxy of poverty at the school level. For example, a financial institution that provides a loan to a school may seek to gauge the income level of the targeted stakeholders of its loan by requiring the school receiving the loan to report this metric. Organizations are also encouraged to report metrics such as School Enrollment: Poor (PI7254), School Enrollment: Very Poor (PI5583), or School Enrollment: Low Income (PI2173) if they have additional demographic details available.

Organizations operating in the United States can refer to the following sources for additional information on free and reduced-price meal programs and eligibility:
- New America: School Funding and Resources/Nutrition and Schools (http://atlas.newamerica.org/federal-school-nutrition-programs#toc-eligibility-and-enrollment)
- USDA Food and Nutrition Service: Income Eligibility Guidelines (http://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/income-eligibility-guidelines)

Organizations that wish to report on the number of subsidized or free school meals provided (both directly and indirectly by other organizations) can use the metric School Meals (PI6971).</skos:scopeNote>

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

Depending on the industry and business model, organizations may define new clients as those who re-engage with the organization after a designated time period.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the organization’s improvement of existing market linkages or acquisition of new kinds of forward or backward market linkages to expand market access.

Forward and backward refer to upstream and downstream supply-chain linkages rather than commodities contracts. Examples of forward linkages include the sale of value-added goods and services to other firms or customers, such as the supply of fertilizers by manufacturing companies to agricultural firms, while backward linkages include the purchase of inputs from suppliers and service providers, such as sourcing raw materials for manufacturing or agro-processing. “Improved” refers to those linkages that the organization believes will add value to its market expansion, whether caused by improvements in technology use or by cheaper or faster service delivery. Linkages may be developed through licensing agreements, new domestic supplier sources, or international sourcing and distribution, among other means.

This metric differs from Business Innovation (OI4718), which is intended to track the organization’s development of innovative products and services.

International Finance Institutions (IFIs) often use this metric as part of their analysis of private sector development.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique urban clients who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of strikes and lockouts occurring among the organization's employees during the reporting period. Strikes and lockouts sometimes represent a breakdown in labor–management relations and a suspension of consultative processes. Data regarding the occurrence of such industrial incidents can usefully convey the state of labor–management relations and the direction of its progression over time. Strikes and lockouts must be set in the context of any limitations of local legislation and benchmarked against norms for inter-country, inter-industry, and inter-category comparisons. As employees take greater freedom in questioning their rights and respect in the workplace, organizations may observe strikes and lockouts increasing. As policies begin to take hold and change is effected, strikes and lockouts may then decrease.

An employee strike is a work stoppage caused by one or several of the following voluntary actions by a number of employees: reducing the normal performance of their employment, breaking their employment agreements, refusing or failing to accept engagement for work in which they are usually employed, reducing their normal output, or reducing their normal rate of work. A strike usually happens in response to employee grievances.

A lockout, also a work stoppage, is a temporary denial of employment initiated by the employer. Lockouts sometimes occur as a bargaining tactic by the employer in response to an employee strike.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether or not an organization has a greenhouse gas emissions strategy and to provide, in footnotes, detailed information on that strategy. It does not, however, evaluate the success with which that strategy is implemented.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions. The GHG Protocol defines direct and indirect emissions as follows:
- Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity.
- Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that result from the activities of the reporting entity but that occur at sources owned or controlled by other entities.

The GHG Protocol further categorizes these direct and indirect emissions into three broad scopes. For more information on the GHG Protocol, organizations should refer to the following:
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards)
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools)

Organizations reporting this metric should also consider reporting against Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Total (OI1479), Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Direct (OI4112), and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Indirect (OI9604).</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on carbon credits.

A number of methodologies offer detailed procedures for quantifying the real GHG benefits of a project, along with guidance to help project developers determine project boundaries, set baselines, assess additionality, and ultimately quantify the GHG emissions that were reduced or removed. For more information and examples, see the Verified Carbon Standard (http://www.v-c-s.org/methodologies/what-methodology).

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of students from poor backgrounds enrolled at the school as of the end of the reporting period, including both full- and part-time students. Each discrete student should be counted once, regardless of number of courses taken.

These data may be most effectively collected through either school reporting (for private schools) or government reporting (for public schools).

Because assessing the poverty level of stakeholders is complex, organizations will likely have to use specific assessment tools to accurately report on this metric. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the sector in which the organization operates. Because the category in which an organization operates (as categorized by its products/services) may differ from the categories it seeks to influence, at least two metrics are necessary to categorize an investment: respectively, Sector of Operations (PD8808) and one or both of Social Impact Objectives (OD6247) and Environmental Impact Objectives (OD4108). For example, a company that develops mobile software to inform rural farmers of real time market price data changes operates in the ICT category, but targets or influences the Agriculture sector. Thus, this organization would select "J. Information and communication" as its Sector of Operations (PD8808), and would select "Increasing Access to Agricultural Training and Information" under its Social Impact Objectives (OD6247).

This list of sectors is aligned to the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, or ISIC (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/ISIC.cshtml).

Organizations can report this metric at an organizational level (selecting all of the categories of focus for the organization) or for a specific product/service (selecting the specific category of focus of the product/service for which the organization is reporting).</skos:scopeNote>

Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, geothermal, hydro energy, and biomass, among other forms. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information.

Large-scale hydropower is often excluded from the definition of renewable energy. Although water itself is a renewable resource, the natural ecology of rivers is not, and hydroelectric dams can adversely affect aquatic ecosystems. Organizations can refer to the Low Impact Hydropower Institute (http://lowimpacthydro.org) for further guidance on creating low-impact hydropower operations.

Organizations may have various motivations for making these capital expenditures, including reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, reducing long-term energy expenditures, increasing the stability of energy pricing, or diversifying their sources of energy supply. Organizations are encouraged to footnote changes in the organization's regular, recurring energy costs caused by their investments in renewable energy infrastructure and technology.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the average percent of total possible points students earned on tests during the reporting period. For example, if Student A earned 75/100 points and Student B earned 30/100 points, the Average Student Test Score for these two students would be 52.5/100 points, or 52.5%. Students who were not tested should not be included in this calculation.

In many cases, test-score data are collected by schools (public or private) or another third party.

In educational contexts, Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) can refer to students and may be used in this calculation in place of School Enrollment (PI2389). Organizations may also disaggregate data by grade level as needed to identify underlying patterns.

In all contexts, tests should reflect learners' social, environmental, and learning norms and needs. Organizations are encouraged to footnote details on how and by whom tests have been developed, as well as how they are fit to context.

Average Student Test Score (PI9024), combined with factors included under "HOW is change happening?," gives a directional indicator of student learning outcomes. In some contexts, however, Student Promotion Rate (PI4924)—which measures the number of students proceeding to the next grade—may be a more appropriate outcome metric. In these cases, Student Promotion Rate (PI4924) should be substituted for Average Student Test Score (PI9024) under WHAT and HOW MUCH. For more details on calculation, see usage guidance for each specific metric in the catalog.

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The IRIS catalog differentiates between land that the organization directly controls and land that the organization indirectly controls. This metric is intended to capture the area of land that is under the organization's direct control and that is treated with pesticides.

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information on pesticide use and the WHO’s Acute Toxicity Hazard Categories. Organizations that use WHO Class Ia (extremely hazardous) and Ib (highly hazardous) pesticides on directly controlled land should footnote additional details on the relevant land (for example, area applied and crops present) and pesticide use.

Direct control refers to land for which the organization controls land use through direct operation or management, including situations in which the organization's employees cultivate the land directly. Note that land ownership is not always equivalent to control. For example, where land is leased to another entity or individual to cultivate (e.g., a third-party manager), land is only directly controlled if the lease is accompanied by exhaustive criteria for land use.

Such land-use criteria are often included in management plans and legal agreements that also incorporate sustainability principles and typically include termination provisions in the event of poor performance. To the extent that the third-party manager must make minimal, ad-hoc, and discretionary land-use decisions that fall outside the scope of the land-use criteria, the land may still be considered directly controlled by the organization.</skos:scopeNote>

Examples of organizations that might report against this metric include those that provide products such as clean cookstoves or water purification systems and those that provide services such as home weatherization. Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The IRIS catalog differentiates between land that the organization directly controls and land that the organization indirectly controls. This metric is intended to capture the area of land that is under the organization's direct control.

Direct control refers to land for which the organization controls land use through direct operation or management, including situations in which the organization's employees cultivate the land directly. Note that land ownership is not always equivalent to control. For example, where land is leased to another entity or individual to cultivate (e.g., a third-party manager), land is only directly controlled if the lease is accompanied by exhaustive criteria for land use.

Such land-use criteria are often included in management plans and legal agreements that also incorporate sustainability principles and typically include termination provisions in the event of poor performance. To the extent that the third-party manager must make minimal, ad-hoc, and discretionary land-use decisions that fall outside the scope of the land-use criteria, the land may still be considered directly controlled by the organization.

Sustainability, in a broad sense, includes sustainable working conditions for employees responsible for land management, resource exploitation that guarantees the continuous delivery of ecosystem services for current and future generations, and even land that has been put under strict no-deforestation requirements. If, for example, a third party manages land under a lease contract, contract conditions and clauses should specify required management, exploitation, ethics, techniques, and conditions of contract termination. The organization should footnote details of these contracts and monitor whether the third party meets the requirements.</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional guidance on defining management. The composition of management varies with an organization’s stage and type, but managers are generally responsible for setting objectives (defining goals for the group and deciding what work must be done to meet those goals), organizing (dividing work into manageable activities and selecting the right people to accomplish them), motivating and communicating (creating a team out of individuals through decisions on pay, promotion, and communications), measuring (establishing targets and interpreting and analyzing performance), and developing people.

Organizations are also encouraged to footnote if the number reported for this metric includes any female managers in the following positions: Chief Executive Officer or President, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief Financial Officer.

To report in line with 2X Challenge requirements, organizations must disaggregate by number of full-time female employees at the Senior Management level using the 2X definition: C-Suite or equivalent (e.g., Managing Directors, Partners). As titles may vary with organizational size and stage, some judgement is required.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture how long on average (in days) it takes the organization to settle claims, measured from the date of the insured incident.

Organizations should calculate this metric using the average days’ duration between the date of an insured incident and the date that the affected stakeholder receives payment or claim denial.

Organizations should footnote a schedule outlining the number of claims settled within specified durations. In this regard, organizations are encouraged to report the number of claims settled within the timeline breakouts recommended by the Microinsurance Network: 7 days, 8–30 days, 31–90 days, and more than 90 days. Where applicable, organizations should note how duration ranges change to match regional norms.

It is not always possible to determine how long it takes for payment to reach the affected stakeholder (i.e., the date benefits were received). In these cases, organizations should estimate using the date on which the claim was paid, footnoting these assumptions.

For more detail on the Promptness of Claims Settlement and the recommended footnote schedule, as well as for guidance on interpretation, see the Microinsurance Network's Social Performance Indicators for Microinsurance, p. 19 (https://www.social-protection.org/gimi/ShowRessource.action?id=5270).</skos:scopeNote>

Healthcare Crude Coverage (PI3902) is an input into Healthcare Effective Coverage (PI7191) – crude coverage is a simple measure of percent of patients needing treatment who received it during the reporting period, while effective coverage includes a measure of quality. Both can be applied at a national, individual, or organizational level; investors are encouraged to apply them at the level of the investee company. While crude coverage is more widely used, experts are increasingly encouraging use of the quality-inclusive effective coverage measure. However, there are not, as of yet, broadly standardized ratios for the “quality of the intervention” element of the calculation. IRIS users are encouraged to document all assumptions used in calculating this measure as well as to use existing publications such as the following to inform their approaches:

In specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <cids:hasDescription xml:lang="en">Net number of new, full-time equivalent employees working for enterprises financed or supported by the organization during the reporting period.

Many organizations select the beginning of the reporting period as the time when the organization began its support or investment.</cids:hasDescription>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used. Organizations that report data for more than one reporting period should be careful to very clearly footnote which they are using for this metric. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture jobs created at supported organizations during the reporting period. Organizations are encouraged to use this metric with Jobs Type (OD0660) to enable disaggregation of these data by key aspects.

Organizations may choose to disclose employment by function (for example, operations and maintenance, construction, or land conservation). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Direct Jobs Created by the Investment (Operations and Maintenance), organizations should include under Jobs Type (OD0660) only the options, “Hiring: Jobs hired through organization itself” and “Hiring: Jobs hired/supported through a third-party and directly related to the organization’s operations and maintenance of company.”

The three metrics for jobs at supported/financed enterprises relate to one another, as follows. Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) and Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) sum to Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). For example, if an investor provided a loan to a small business that had 10 employees at the time the loan was provided and 15 employees as of the end of the reporting period, Jobs Created at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI3687) would be 5; Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874) would be 15; and Jobs Maintained at Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises: Total (PI5691) would be 10.

Direct jobs in the context of this metric are defined according to the scope of the project (for instance, jobs created at a company that receives investment), following project logic and objectives. For some types of financial intermediaries, organizations should footnote a clear definition of direct jobs. For instance, if measured using a capacity-building approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the direct, operational level. If defined using an economic impact approach, direct jobs supported are identified at the level of the final beneficiary (e.g., SMEs or investees).

While this metric requests data on full-time equivalents (FTE), organizations are encouraged to break down these data for full- and part-time positions supported/financed. Most companies break down their headcount into full- and part-time positions, which investors often translate into FTE. For translation from headcount to FTE, organizations should refer to the following guidance, as well as the IRIS glossary term on full-time equivalent. In brief, in calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs, part-time jobs should be converted to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, following local definitions (for example, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20-hour-per-week job would be 0.5 FTE). Both full- and part-time jobs should be calculated based on the number employed as of the end of the reporting period. Seasonal or short-term jobs should be prorated based on the time worked during the reporting period. (For example, a full-time position for three months at any point during the reporting period would be 0.25 FTE.) If information about hours is not available, organizations may equate two part-time jobs to one full-time job for this calculation. Note that, in the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department defines a working week as 35 hours.

If there is significant seasonal variation in the number of workers, organizations are encouraged to average the number of FTEs over the reporting period for temporary workers, using the FTE calculation above. Where companies employ piece-rate workers, consider the headcount of the number of workers paid piece-rate and estimate the proportion of FTE represented by that category of workers (e.g., if there are 200 piece-rate workers on site each day for 6 months of the year, then FTE = 200 x 6/12 = 100). Similarly, if an organization has many workers on variable hours or contracts, including day laborers, organizations are encouraged to include the average number of workers on a typical day (total over 24 hours, if shift work), as well as the proportion of the year those employees are working.

Organizations are encouraged to report other job-related metrics to assess the quality of jobs created. Examples of these include Worker Safety Policy (018001), Employment Benefits (OI2742), Employees Trained (OI4229), Flexible Work Arrangements (OI7983), and Employees: Minimum Wage (OI5858).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). This metric may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

Species richness refers to the number of species in an area. Species abundance refers to the number of individuals per species.

Investors are strongly encouraged to contextualize their projects – and ideally select projects – based on broader, country- or region-level biodiversity and landscape assessments focused on site irreplaceability.

Organizations should not calculate this metric using aggregate data across all suppliers. Rather, as noted in the calculation, organizations should use farmer-specific data. Organizations should report yield from the most the recent harvest and footnote details on the unit of measure.

This metric could be valuable for organizations that procure from farmers and provide support to improve their yields, such as training and technical assistance.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the GHG emissions reduced or mitigated as a result of products the organization sold during the reporting period. The product-lifetime reduction in GHG emissions is calculated by subtracting Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Product (PD9427) from Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Product Replaced (PD2243). This is then multiplied by the units/volume sold per product to get the total GHG reductions over the lifetime of the product(s). These GHG reductions are then summed across all products sold during the reporting period.

When multiplying GHG reductions from each product sold by Units/Volume Sold: Total (PI1263), organizations should, under Units/Volume Sold: Total (PI1263), use the absolute number of product units sold rather than the volume of GHG reductions delivered by the product.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions. For more information on the GHG Protocol, organizations should refer to the following:
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards)
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools)

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether the organization has a strategy to engage with its local stakeholder communities. Community engagement strategies involve intentional approaches to align the development priorities of local communities with the goals of the organization.

Examples of strategy elements, to footnote, may include: providing deliberate resources (e.g., employee time and skills, in-kind giving, leadership) to community organizations or individuals, providing education and skills training, creating opportunities for employee volunteering and fundraising, contracting to local suppliers, lobbying to strengthen local issues, facilitating discussions with local leaders, integrating the company's community engagement activities into organizational functions, creating institutional policies and incentives for community engagement, and measuring the social impact of the organization's community engagement activities.

The strategy may also dictate methods (e.g., memoranda of understanding) for considering, informing, and consulting with existing community groups before implementing organizational activities that affect the community. For example, organizations may assess and take into account existing formal, informal, and historic land-use rights of local communities or Indigenous peoples prior to operations that affect the land.

Historical land titles offer one way to evaluate which communities to engage. LandMark (http://www.landmarkmap.org/) provides data on Indigenous and community land rights. In engaging the community, organizations should use a consent process to ensure that the entire community endorses the project and not just a few elite members.

Biodiversity conservation projects will often require involving traditional landowners or others from the community who rely on the land.

Organizations can refer to the following sources for further guidance on community engagement strategies:

This metric is intended to capture the average output per hectare for farmers among an organization's clients.

Organizations should not calculate this metric using aggregate data across all farmers. Rather, as noted in the calculation, organizations should use farmer-specific data. Organizations should report yield from the most recent harvest and footnote details on the unit of measure.

This metric could be valuable for organizations that sell inputs (such as fertilizer or irrigation equipment) to farmers that help improve yields.

Organizations interested in reporting the yields of supplier farmers should report Average Supplier Agriculture Yield: Total (PI2046).

When reporting against this metric, organizations should qualitatively describe the relationship between their activities and their target stakeholders, as indicated under Target Stakeholders (OD7212), focusing primarily on the number and types of intermediaries.

For example, an organization manufacturing solar lanterns and distributing them through a network of distributors might respond: "We target clients and distributors as our stakeholders. The end users of the solar lanterns (clients) benefit from gaining access to clean electricity and light, and the distributors/retailers of the solar lanterns benefit by having jobs and income."

An organization that procures produce from farmers might respond: "The smallholder farmers that supply the mangoes to the organization to produce mango juice are our target stakeholders. A portion of the mangoes are purchased directly from farmers, and the remaining mangoes are purchased from a local cooperative which purchases directly from farmers."</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the percentage of students who left school permanently during the reporting period. For example, if 10 students enrolled in Grade Five and nine have finished as of the end of the reporting period (meaning that one student dropped out), the student dropout rate is calculated as 1/10 = 10%. This metric differs from Student Promotion Rate (PI4924), which captures students proceeding a higher grade of schooling during the reporting period.

This metric aligns with the UNESCO Institute for Statistics Indicator "Dropout Rate by Grade (PR)" (http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/education-indicators-technical-guidelines-en_0.pdf).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether the organization has a formal, stated strategy for setting goals (and associated time-bound targets), progressing toward, and reporting on racial equity.

Beyond indicating whether such a strategy exists, organizations are strongly encouraged to footnote details on their strategy and staff members responsible for implementation. Organizations should carefully consider which staff members and stakeholders are involved in crafting their strategy and how frequently they will update that strategy.

For further guidance on what to include in a racial equity strategy, see the Resources tab. Examples of considerations include: setting and publicly disclosing targets around capital deployed to companies or communities led by individuals from groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity; adoption of new hiring, retention, and advancement practices to combat implicit racial bias and address structural barriers; and grievance mechanisms. For further details on equitable employment that can be applied to investor and investee organizations, see the IRIS+ Quality Jobs theme (iris.thegiin.org).

The organization's racial equity strategy should be informed by the outcome of periodic racial equity audits.

This metric aligns with the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance’s (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/) Investor Blueprint for Racial Equity and CEO Blueprint for Racial Equity (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/2021-blueprint).</skos:scopeNote>

It may be divided by the total number of employees (Permanent Employees: Total [OI8869] + Temporary Employees [OI9028]) to capture the percentage (× 100) of all employees protected by collective bargaining agreements.

Collective bargaining is defined as "all negotiations which take place between one or more employers or employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers' organizations (trade unions), on the other, for determining working conditions and terms of employment or for regulating relations between employers and workers. Collective agreements can be at the level of the organization; at the industry level, in countries where that is the practice; or at both. Collective agreements can cover specific groups of workers; for example, those performing a specific activity or working at a specific location. This definition is based on the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 154, ‘Collective Bargaining Convention’, 1981" (GRI Disclosure 402-1).

Organizations should note whether all employees are able to participate in collective bargaining agreements and, if not, which employees are unable to participate.

Because assessing the poverty level of stakeholders is complex, organizations will likely have to use specific assessment tools to accurately complete the footnoted assessments. See the glossary definition for additional information on commonly used tools to help determine the absolute poverty level of individuals and households. Additional information related to poverty assessment is also available in the SPI4 (specifically, Essential Practice 1b5).

Organizations may use Product/Service Detailed Type (PD1516) to describe or disaggregate this metric by services provided. This metric, compared to the total duration of the reporting period, indicates the quality of services provided.

Organizations are encouraged to use this metric in combination with Service Hours Provided (PI5683). Organizations may choose to use Service Hours Interrupted (PI2230) to capture the total hours of interruption rather than the number of interruptions.

In sanitation-related investments, this metric captures the number of blockages in the sewer system. Blockages can reflect many underlying issues, including the effectiveness of routine operational and maintenance activities, the hydraulic performance of the network, and the general condition of the pipes. The number of blockages comprises administrative data that should come from the service provider (for example, the utility company). This metric is aligned with IBNET 10.1 and 79 (https://www.ib-net.org/toolkit/ibnet-data/sewerage-service/).

This metric is often used by International Finance Institutions (IFIs) as part of infrastructure analysis.

Such organizations are showing more authentic transparency and supporting broader change.

Communications captured under this metric may include a public statement in support of racial equity but should additionally share progress made toward racial equity goals, transparently disclose challenges experienced, and call on others in the sector (e.g., the investment community) to support racial equity (e.g., in investing). In other words, a statement alone is insufficient for a racial equity lens but is an important precursor to further work.

For further guidance on racial equity statements, see the Resources section within the IRIS+ Racial Equity theme.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique clients with disabilities who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

Organizations should footnote details on the training(s) provided, including the type.

Registrations for training should not be counted under this metric. Rather, this metric should count those employees who completed a training session or series during the reporting period.

Organizations may also choose to report on additional feedback systems in place to capture positive feedback and questions. Organizations can refer to the glossary for more information on feedback systems.

Examples of relevant details to footnote may include: the frequency with which employee feedback is solicited or received, whether the system enables anonymity or confidentiality, whether there are established procedures to handle feedback, whether a regular employee satisfaction survey is conducted, and other relevant aspects of the feedback system.

Negative employee feedback, such as an employee complaint, is also known as a grievance if it is a claim by an employee who is being adversely affected by a misinterpretation or misapplication of a written organizational policy or collectively bargained agreement. Employee grievances typically relate to issues such as pay and benefits, workload, working conditions, and union and management relations. For example, a grievance may include an incident of sexual harassment, wage inequity for comparable work, increased workload without increased pay, or unsafe work conditions, among many other scenarios.

Organizations can refer to the SPI4 (http://cerise-spi4.squarespace.com/), specifically Essential Practices 5a3 and 5c1, for additional indicators related to employee feedback systems. SPI4 is a social audit tool, developed for financial service providers, which can apply to any organization with both social and financial objectives.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including the local definition of full-time employment.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of employees managing an organization’s social and environmental performance.

In calculating the number of full-time equivalent jobs (FTEs), organizations should convert part-time jobs to full-time equivalent jobs on a pro rata basis, based on local definitions. (For instance, if the standard working week equals 40 hours, a 20 hour/week job would be equal to 0.5 FTEs). In this calculation, organizations should also consider the share of employees’ duties allocated to managing social and environmental performance. For instance, if an organization had 4 full-time employees working on social and environmental performance issues each for half of their work time, they would report 2 FTEs under this metric.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact: it may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the quantity of meals provided by the organization (school) to target stakeholders (for example, students) for free or at a subsidized price during the reporting period.

Organizations should include both meals funded directly by the organization and those paid for by another organization or specific donors.

Meals included in this calculation may be provided to both full- and part-time students, if applicable, with each discrete student counted once regardless of the number of courses taken.

This metric and the associated Percent Students Receiving Free and Subsidized School Meals (PI4555) are frequently used as a proxy of poverty at the school level. For example, a financial institution that provides a loan to a school may seek to gauge the income level of the targeted stakeholders of its loan by requiring the school receiving the loan to report this metric. Organizations are also encouraged to report metrics such as School Enrollment: Poor (PI7254), School Enrollment: Very Poor (PI5583), or School Enrollment: Low Income (PI2173) if they have additional demographic details available.

Organizations operating in the United States can refer to the following sources for additional information on free and reduced-price meal programs and eligibility:

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to estimate gender wage equity at an organization. If women and men are paid the same average wage for the same position, the ratio would be 1.

This ratio can be calculated based on salaried employees with fixed wages or on employees with variable salaries (such as hourly, daily, weekly, other specified time cycle, or other specified parameter).

Organizations should footnote the specific position used in calculating this ratio, including whether the position is a managerial or non-managerial role. Organizations reporting this metric for multiple positions are encouraged to report these various data points for gender wage equity and to specify the position to which each data point corresponds.

While this metric helps organizations begin to understand gender wage equity in their operations, organizations are cautioned that other factors may affect the data collected. For example, the average wages reported for this metric may only be meaningful if multiple individuals of both genders have a similar position within the organization. Employee education, experience, and tenure at the organization, among other factors, may also influence wage disparities.

In specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

The categorization of groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute minorities, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the rate at which individuals are involuntarily removed from housing units. Organizations should footnote the reasons for their removal.

Organizations should calculate the number of tenants involuntarily removed from housing (‘evicted’) during the reporting period on the same basis as the total number of tenants reported under Client Individuals: Total (PI4060). If, for instance, the reporting organization manages housing units, the organization should calculate the number of tenants (and the number of evicted tenants) in housing units managed by the organization. If the reporting organization finances housing units, the organization should report the number of tenants (and evicted tenants) in housing units financed by the organization.

In specific contexts, and based on evidence, this metric may serve as a proxy indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the percentage of clients (for example, job services clients or students in vocational or technical training) who were placed in jobs during the reporting period. Organizations should include only those clients who were placed in and began jobs during the reporting period. They should exclude clients who were placed in jobs but did not begin work.

Organizations are also encouraged to provide details on the types of activities they conducted to increase job placement rates, such as (but not limited to): monitoring workforce trends to ensure alignment between program offerings and workforce needs, surveying employers (to capture position offerings, skills needed, and likely wages), strengthening relationships with potential employers, providing resources (such as interview tips, career fairs, and job leads) to assist job searches and career development, and creating program alumni networks.

In the case of employees assisted to find jobs, organizations may use total employees assisted as the denominator in this formula, calculated as: Permanent Employees: Total (OI8869) + Temporary Employees (OI9028), disaggregated into the number of employees using the job-placement benefit specified by Employment Benefits (OI2742).

For work integrating social enterprises (WISE), a high job placement rate is an indicator of success. High rates of voluntary turnover can also be an indicator of success along these lines, which organizations can capture using Employee Voluntary Turnover Rate (OI1638).

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact.

- Individual lending
- Solidarity group lending
- Village/self-help group lending
- Digital financial services
- Agency banking

- Roving staff/mobile branches

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations selecting ‘Other’ should footnote the type of delivery methodology they use.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture how organizations operating in microfinance (and primarily those providing lending services) deliver financial services.

With an individual lending methodology, a loan is made to an individual borrower who is solely responsible for its repayment.

With a solidarity group lending methodology, funds are disbursed to groups, with collection of repayment either from the group as a whole or from the individual members of that group. Borrowers in such groups often bear joint and several liability for the repayment of all loans to the group and its members. See the glossary term for additional information.

With a village/self-help group lending methodology, the organization provides access to credit and savings services through group- or community-managed associations. The organization may lend to the group, which in turn uses the provided funds to lend to its members. See the glossary term for additional information.

With agency banking, the organization extends their branch network to more distributed populations (e.g., rural populations) via authorized agents (branchless banking). Benefits of this methodology include cost-effectiveness, risk management, product availability, improved financial inclusion, and a wider customer base.

With licensed agents, individuals or businesses are empowered to act on behalf of a financial service provider (FSP) to perform certain financial or administrative transactions. They may have a direct contractual relationship with the FSP or may be contracted by a third party (a super-agent or aggregator) that maintains a service agreement with the FSP.

Roving staff/mobile branches serve customers outside of branches in their places of residence or business. They may or may not be associated with a particular branch. This methodology includes only staff or mobile units that manage deposits or handle opening customer accounts (other than loan origination).

With ATMs (automated teller machines), customers access services via machines at fixed locations through different means of identification (card, PIN, biometrics). ATMs offer different kinds of cash- or non-cash-based operations (such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account balance consultation). ATMs may be proprietary or managed by third parties.

With mobile banking, clients access services through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) or Short Message Service (SMS) communications via their mobile devices.

With Internet-based banking services, clients access services through a personal device (smartphone app or website) using standard Internet protocols.

With merchant POS (point-of-sale) or network, a merchant uses a physical payment processing device, located at the merchant’s place of business and connected to a network, to accept payment for the sale of goods or services from customers of the financial service provider using their means of identification from the FSP (card or other). The merchant could be owned directly by the FSP or simply have access to a network enabling the merchant to process payments.

Organizations using an ‘other’ approach to delivering microfinance should describe the method or approach used.

Organizations can refer to the following resources for additional guidance:

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture detailed information on the energy conservation strategy in place but does not evaluate the success with which the strategy is implemented.

Energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce the amount of energy needed to execute current processes or tasks. Organizations should not include an overall reduction in energy consumption from reduced organizational activities (e.g., partial outsourcing of production).

Details of energy conservation efforts to footnote include organizational or technological innovations that allow a defined process or task to consume energy more efficiently. These may include Building Area of Energy Efficiency Improvements (PI1586), conversion to renewable energy sources, or the elimination of unnecessary energy use due to changes in behavior. Further examples of energy efficiency efforts, sourced from GRESB, include: automatic meter readings (AMR), automation system upgrades/replacements, management systems upgrades/replacements, installation of high-efficiency equipment and appliances, installation of on-site renewable energy, occupier engagement/informational technologies, smart grid/smart building technologies, systems commissioning or retro-commissioning, wall/roof insulation, and window replacements.

The reduction in the organization's energy usage may not necessarily correlate with a reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions; organizations are encouraged to report separately their Greenhouse Gas Emissions Strategy (OI8237), where applicable.

Organizations are encouraged to report the amount of energy conserved using Energy Conserved (OI6697), as well as Energy Purchased: Total (OI8825) and its two categories, Energy Purchased: Non-Renewable (OI1496) and Energy Purchased: Renewable (OI3324).</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The metric is intended to capture whether the organization has measured nitrogen and phosphorus levels in streams or rivers on land it manages. Nitrogen and phosphorus levels are key determinants of stream health. Although nitrogen and phosphorus are crucial for life on Earth, agricultural fertilization, cattle breeding, and industrial emissions can oversaturate ecosystems with these elements, which leads to habitat degradation by eutrophication.

Organizations should measure nutrients, including phosphorus and nitrogen, immediately downstream of controlled land—as reported by Land Directly Controlled: Total (OI5408), Land Indirectly Controlled: Total (PI3789), and related submetrics—and preferably at both base and storm flows. Guidance on measuring nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations can be found at EPA’s Total Nitrogen (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/totalnitrogen.pdf) and Phosphorus (https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/html/vms56.html) pages.

Organizations are encouraged to footnote summary statistics of these data and should consult national, sub-national, or tribal standards to determine whether measured nutrient levels are within environmentally sustainable levels, as local and international water quality legislation often specify limits and target values for nutrient levels in water.</skos:scopeNote>

This metric is intended to capture the amount of renewable energy both produced and used by the organization. For example, if an organization installed solar panels at its factory, it would report the amount of energy produced and used from those panels.

Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, geothermal, hydro energy, and biomass, among other forms. Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional information.

Large-scale hydropower is often excluded from the definition of renewable energy. Although water itself is a renewable resource, the natural ecology of rivers is not, and hydroelectric dams can adversely affect aquatic ecosystems. Organizations can refer to the Low Impact Hydropower Institute (&lt;http://lowimpacthydro.org&gt;) for further guidance on creating low-impact hydropower operations.

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote details on the analyses conducted. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture whether the organization analyzes clients’ repayment capacity. Lenders conduct repayment capacity analyses to compare a borrower's cash or income sources to a borrower's uses of credit, thereby ensuring that the borrower has sufficient sources to repay their debt. Repayment capacity analyses should be systematic and complete to ensure that lending decisions are based on an appropriate debt-to-income ratio.

Organizations should disclose the financial costs to borrowers for the most representative loan product, which closely tracks the cost clients carry. They should compare these costs with those of similar products offered to similar populations by other organizations in the same country or region.

Examples of practices for repayment capacity analyses, to footnote, include, among others, relying on more information than just guarantees (whether peer guarantees, co-signature, or collateral), such as household surplus; taking into consideration the possibility of additional, undisclosed debt; disseminating the organization's repayment capacity policy among employees; uniformly applying the repayment capacity policy in practice; performing analyses at each loan cycle; and visiting clients to verify information. Organizations should also note whether they restructure products/services in cases where repayment is an issue.

Organizations can refer to the Smart Campaign (http://www.smartcampaign.org/storage/documents/avoidance.pdf) for further guidance on conducting repayment capacity analyses.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to provide detailed information on the threatened species policy or policies in place but does not evaluate the success with which that policy is implemented.

Threatened species are any species (including animals, plants, and fungi) which are endangered or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The term “threatened” captures multiple levels of threat to species: vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered. Organizations should refer to the glossary for more detail on what is classified as a threatened species.

In addition to describing policies to protect threatened species, organizations are encouraged to footnote details on the threatened species that reside in terrestrial or aquatic habitats affected by the organization's operations, as determined by risk categories (e.g., vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered) developed by recognized authorities such as IUCN (www.iucn.org) or CITES (www.cites.org). IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species provides information about the global extinction risk faced by animal, plant and fungus species, as well as their range, population size, habitat, and conservation measures. CITES provides information on species threatened by international trade. Local endangered species platforms, such as those provided by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, are also available. Species are categorized in these databases according to their degree of extinction, which suggests a corresponding prioritization of conservation measures for species and their habitats. If reported, organizations should use the common name of each included species. Organizations can compare and verify their categorizations against the lists of the authority they reference.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that were reduced by the organization during the reporting period. This metric should be used in combination with Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation Types (OI9839) in order to disaggregate the types of greenhouse gas emissions reductions as relevant to the organization's activities.

Calculating greenhouse gas emissions reductions is a technical process. In calculating this metric, organizations should align with an accepted standard, such as the American Carbon Registry or Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see specific guidance document. No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

School time is the total amount of time spent in school.

Instructional time is the portion of classroom time devoted to the teaching and learning of curricular subjects.

Engaged time (also known as time-on-task) refers to the portion of time during which students are paying attention to a learning task and attempting to learn.

Supportive learning time, which is particularly important in early childhood, refers to time spent actively engaging with a caretaker who makes sense of and validates their learning (also known as “serve and return”). For more information on supportive learning time, see Harvard University's Center for the Developing Child (https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/serve-and-return/).

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of employees who received a regular, routine performance and career development review during the reporting period. To qualify under this metric, reviews must be based on clear criteria understood by both the manager and employee, must occur with adequate notice to the employee, and must occur at least once per year. A review may—but is not required to—include an evaluation by the employee’s direct superior, their peers, a wider range of employees, or the human resources department, as well as the employee's own reflections on their quality of work.

This metric is sourced from Disclosure 404-3 in GRI 404: Training and Education 2016: Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews.

Regular performance reviews support the professional development of employees, contribute to skills management, and build human capital within the organization. Such reviews can also increase employee satisfaction, which can improve organizational performance.

This metric may help describe the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. The selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote further details about the types of stakeholder(s) they target.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the basic demographic groups of target stakeholders of an organization's products, services, and operations. A target stakeholder can be a client, employee, or anyone the organization is aiming to positively impact. Some organizations call a target stakeholder a ‘beneficiary.’

Target stakeholders—whether clients, employees, or others—should self-report their own demographic data to ensure accuracy, particularly for race and gender. Organizations should not assume gender for an individual and should protect vulnerable individuals in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum by reporting these data anonymously and in aggregate. Given that transwomen are women and transmen are men, this metric does not create separate segmentations for those groups. However, organizations are encouraged to create additional groupings using the write-in option as needed to capture those lived experiences that are helpful in understanding equity in outcomes.


The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture all unique clients who received products or services provided by the organization for which it did not request payment and for which it does not expect reimbursement. If the organization expects or receives payment from someone other than the client, these client individuals should be reported against Client Individuals: No Direct Payment (PI1807). This metric is intended to measure clients receiving free products/services that are core to the operations of the organization providing them; for example, some healthcare clinics provide free health check-ups.

Organizations should include the number of unique client individuals who received free products or services, regardless of whether or not these same individuals also paid the organization for certain products or services during the reporting period.

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome.

Bulk energy is usually sold under a power purchase agreement with an electricity utility. The buyer or purchaser of this energy is termed the offtaker.

This metric can be reported in conjunction with Energy Generated for Sale: Total (PI8706). Organizations are also encouraged to footnote the year-over-year changes in the type(s) of energy generated for sale, along with corresponding changes to GHG emissions.

Organizations can refer to the following sources for further guidance:

Incurred claims include all gross paid claims during the period, plus a reasonable estimate of unpaid liabilities. Unpaid liabilities can be calculated as a sum of the change in reserves (including the reserve of claims incurred but not reported), course of settlement reserve, and accrued liabilities reserve.

This metric is used in calculating Incurred Claims Ratio (FP8478), which helps assess the value of an insurance product per premium paid.</skos:scopeNote>

Each discrete student should be counted once, regardless of number of courses taken.

These data may be most effectively collected through either school reporting (for private schools) or government reporting (for public schools).

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized due to race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.

See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to measure the number of employees earning the lowest hourly wage paid by the organization during the reporting period. For example, if the organization's lowest wage paid (including bonuses, excluding benefits) is USD 15 per hour and the organizations pays 300 employees this rate, the value for this metric is 300. Organizations should also footnote what the lowest wage paid is in order to enable minimum wage calculations.

To use this metric effectively, organizations working across multiple geographies should capture it at the country level. For each country, organizations should capture the lowest hourly wage paid and the number of employees earning that wage. In the event that an organization is unable to capture these data for each country, organizations are encouraged to capture this metric for the country with the largest number of employees.

For salaried workers, organizations may calculate hourly wage by dividing total annual wages by number of hours worked.

This metric can be useful in capturing whether a portion of the organization's workforce is paid less than minimum wage. Organizations interested in capturing minimum wage or living wage may instead use Employees Earning Minimum Wage (OI5858) and Employees Earning a Living Wage or Higher (OI4724).

In some contexts, this metric can serve as an indicator of whether the outcome being sought by an investor or organization is occurring (the WHAT dimension of impact). For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the ecosystem services provided by land or marine area the organization directly or indirectly controls. Note that what is most critical for organizations to capture is not necessarily the long list of ecosystem services provided, but rather the key ecosystem services and their quality. Organizations may choose to identify the top 3-5 ecosystem services provided from this list, then track their changes in quality over time.

The number, variety, and balance of ecosystem services is a good indicator of ecosystem health. A disproportionate share of human-induced provisioning services like crops and timber generally indicates poor ecosystem health (e.g., intensive agriculture, intensive forestry). The value of  ecosystem services can be expressed in physical (e.g., amount of groundwater supplied in m³) or monetary terms. Monetary valuation of ecosystem services is complex and requires expert support but enables comparison and aggregation. Assessing ecosystem services at the site or project level uses specific tools such as InVEST or Aries and generally requires expert advice.

The societal value of ecosystems is deeply related to the benefits they provide people, specifically ecosystem services, making this metric a proxy for the social value of biodiversity. Organizations are encouraged to report this metric alongside others in the Biodiversity IRIS+ Core Metrics Set, as tailored to context, that give a complementary, more complete picture of biodiversity performance.

Examples of details to footnote include how the ecosystem provides the selected ecosystem services, the methodology used to measure and value the ecosystem services, information on which services were covered, and any external validation or verification conducted to evaluate the provision of the selected ecosystem services. For external validation or verification, organizations should footnote which services were covered, the date of evaluation, and the entity conducting verification/validation (e.g., university researcher, consultant, ecosystem services bank).

Organizations can apply this metric in risk screening (‘which ecosystem services are at risk due to the investment?’), identifying restoration opportunities (‘which ecosystem services can benefit from an investment in restoration?’), and comparison (‘which product innovations or locations for restoration are most promising in terms of generating ecosystem services?’).

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Protected Land Area: Total (PI4716), Protected Land Area: Permanent (PI3924), Land Directly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (OI6912), Land Indirectly Controlled: Sustainably Managed (PI6796), Land Directly Controlled: Total (OI5408), and Land Indirectly Controlled: Total (PI3789).

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including source(s) of data.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the level of water treatment enacted by the organization during the reporting period. Organizations may report the level of treatment for any water or effluents at the point of discharge, whether treated themselves onsite or sent to a third party for treatment. Both lagoon and mechanical treatment can be included, where appropriate.

This metric applies to all elements of water discharge, including used water, unused water, and effluents. Organizations may use this metric to disaggregate Water Discharged (OD0386) by volume of water treated. For sanitation-related investments, organizations should disaggregate and apply this calculation specifically to wastewater.

Treating water aims to improve water’s quality to make it more acceptable for an end-use, such as drinking, industry, or safe return to the environment, by removing or reducing existing water contaminants. Increasing population pressure is increasing the amount of wastewater. Untreated effluent is discharged to water bodies and terrestrial ecosystems, leading to nutrient surpluses (which can cause anoxic conditions and species loss) and the presence of toxic, often non-degradable compounds in ecosystems. Untreated wastewater contains pathogens that can contaminate drinking water. Treating and recycling polluted water can help tackle water shortages.

Minimum requirements for treatment might be specified by national, sub-national, or local legislation; in setting treatment levels, however, organizations should consider the impacts of their overall water discharge and the needs of other water users. For further guidance on treatment requirements, see SDG 6: Progress on Wastewater Treatment (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275967/9789241514897-eng.pdf?ua=1).</skos:scopeNote>

Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

Organizations that provide goods and services at the individual level, such as vaccines or school lunches, may find it more appropriate to report against Client Individuals: Total (PI4060) and related submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of client households using direct data. For example, organizations that sell water purification systems through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client households reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of temporary employees who worked for the organization at any point during the reporting period. For example, if an employee worked at some point during the reporting period but was not employed as of the end of the reporting period, such an individual should be counted under this metric.

Temporary employees include contracted (or subcontracted) employees, whether their contracts are written or oral; in any case, temporary employment is characterized by a predefined term: fixed-term contracts, project- or task-based contracts, and seasonal, intermittent, or casual work.

Relevant details to footnote regarding the type of temporary employment provided could include, among other things, the typical duration of temporary employees’ contracts and the breakdown between full- and part-time temporary employees.

Organizations are encouraged to report this metric in conjunction with Temporary Employee Hours Worked (OI8408). To align to the HIPSO (Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations) indicator Construction Jobs (Temporary Construction), organizations may use this metric and calculate using it and Temporary Employee Hours Worked (OI8408) the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs. For more on this calculation, see Jobs in Directly Supported/Financed Enterprises (PI4874). In order to align with this HIPSO indicator, organizations should include all workers involved in the construction of any company assets, including those employed by third parties if they are working on-site; however, organizations should exclude construction workers if the organization itself is a construction or real estate company.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact.

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the percentage of students that have continued from one grade to the next—for example, from the third to the fourth year of secondary school. For instance, if 100 students had completed their third year of secondary school as of the end of the previous reporting period and 95 have continued to the fourth year of secondary school as of the beginning of the reporting period, the student promotion rate is 95%, calculated as 95/100 × 100.

This metric differs from Student Dropout Rate (PI9910), which captures the rate at which students drop out during the reporting period.

This metric aligns with the UNESCO Institute for Statistics Indicator “Promotion Rate by Grade (PR)” (http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/education-indicators-technical-guidelines-en_0.pdf). This metric can be used as an input to calculate “Transition Rate” between schooling levels (for example, from primary to secondary school)

    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture pre-tax wages and salaries paid to the organization's management employees who belong to historically marginalized groups and should include neither benefits nor payroll expenses. This metric should exclude Temporary Employee Wages (OI4202).

Organizations can refer to the glossary for additional guidance on defining management. The composition of management varies with an organization's stage and type, but managers are generally responsible for setting objectives (defining goals for the group and deciding what work must be done to meet those goals), organizing (dividing work into manageable activities and selecting the right people to accomplish them), motivating and communicating (creating a team out of individuals through decisions on pay, promotion, and communications), measuring (establishing targets and interpreting and analyzing performance), and developing people.

The categorization of historically marginalized groups varies with location and context. With no internationally agreed-upon definition as to which groups constitute historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity, if well-established local policies exist (as in South Africa, with the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment [BBBEE] definition of historically marginalized, or in India, based on backward caste), organizations should refer to these local guidelines to identify groups historically marginalized on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. Otherwise, and wherever appropriate, organizations should provide additional detail regarding their tailored methodology for defining these groups.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the value of the investing organization's support for capacity-building efforts at companies in their portfolio as of the end of the reporting period. Organizations should include only that support they paid for directly and should exclude any support funded by third parties.

Per the United Nations (https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/capacity-building), capacity building is "the process of developing and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, processes and resources that organizations and communities need to survive, adapt, and thrive in a fast-changing world." For entrepreneurs and companies, capacity building can include trainings in fundraising techniques, fiscal management, or other business skills; support in recruiting and hiring staff or volunteers; networking support; consulting services regarding process implementation; mentoring; and purchasing IT and other equipment or resources to support business growth.

For an example of how investors can provide capacity-building support to entrepreneurs, see "Unleashing the Potential of Entrepreneurs of Color in Massachusetts: A Blueprint for Economic Growth and Equitable Recovery" (https://massinc.org/research/entrepreneurs-of-color/).

Used along with Target Stakeholder Demographic (PD5752) to specify historically marginalized groups due to race and/or ethnicity, this metric aligns with the Corporate Racial Equity Alliance’s (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/) Investor Blueprint for Racial Equity and its corporate-focused CEO Blueprint for Racial Equity (https://corporateracialequityalliance.org/2021-blueprint).</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote all assumptions used, including source of data. See usage guidance for further information.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the number of unique peri-urban clients who received the organization’s products or services during the reporting period. It is not a measure of foot traffic, nor is it intended to capture the number of consumer transactions. For example, a customer who makes two purchases during a period should be counted only once. Organizations wishing to report on total client transactions should refer to Client Transactions (PI5184).

This metric is intended to capture the unique number of specific individuals served. Organizations should not use any household multipliers when reporting against this metric. If organizations consider entire households to be the customer/client, they can report against Client Households: Total (PI7954) and its associated submetrics.

Many organizations may not be able to report on the number of clients using direct data. For example, organizations that sell solar lanterns through a series of local network distributors might estimate the number of client individuals reached based on the number of units sold. Organizations should footnote details on how and why these assumptions were made.

For healthcare providers, “client individuals” refers to patients. For housing providers, “client individuals” refers to residents or tenants.

This metric is multi-dimensional with regard to the five dimensions of impact. It may help describe the WHO dimension when the stakeholder group represented by the metric is the stakeholder group targeted by the investment or organization. It may also help measure the HOW MUCH Scale dimension, which helps estimate the number of the targeted stakeholders experiencing the outcome. For more on the alignment of IRIS metrics to the five dimensions of impact, see IRIS+ and the Five Dimensions of Impact (https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-the-five-dimensions/). No single metric is sufficient to understand an impact; rather, metrics are selected as a set across all dimensions of impact. When possible, the selection of metrics to measure and describe the five dimensions should be based on best practice and evidence.</skos:scopeNote>

    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Organizations should footnote the details on the product replaced, including source of data on its GHG emissions, along with other calculation assumptions.</skos:note>
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">This metric is intended to capture the GHG emissions of the product that is being replaced by a product from the organization, with emissions measured over the lifetime of the organization's product. For example, an organization that sells solar lights might report the product replaced as a kerosene lamp, reporting against this metric the GHG emissions from that replaced kerosene lamp over the lifetime of the organization's solar light.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is the most widely used international accounting tool to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions. For more information on the GHG Protocol, organizations should refer to the following:
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standards (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards)
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol Calculators (https://ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools)

In some circumstances, this metric can help describe the CONTRIBUTION an enterprise likely had to the degree of change (depth) in outcome that the stakeholders experienced, relative to what the market or social system would have done anyway.
